With talk of starts in the United States and Japan bubbling away, Israel, a country with no cycle racing heritage, came calling. “Israel wasn’t European and that was the deal breaker,” said the Giro’s race director, Mauro Vegni. “It was a unique opportunity that was too big to turn down.” Normal Israelis will enjoy their country’s first ever international cycling race, free-to-watch and surrounded by festivities. The frustration felt by Jerusalem’s Israeli shopkeepers towards the city’s sports-mad mayor, Nir Barkat, will subside when they count the tourist shekels in their coffers.</p> \n<p>The Giro’s Italian owners, RCS Media Group, have won a rare first ahead of the French behemoth, Amaury Sports Organisation (ASO), which counts the Tour and the Vuelta in its commercial monopoly on the sport. The state of Israel has purchased a televisual picture postcard with the words “wish you were here” written on the back for an estimated €17m, a fraction of the cost of other major sporting events even when the bills for the vast security operation come in.</p>"

Instead, Roos said, a team could go a long way to being a perennial force if it recruited well (which, he said, means more than simply signing the best players money can buy), had a strong team culture and was well served by a few key leaders, both in the coaching team and playing ranks.\nIf the long-standing excellence of the Swans proves Roos is onto something, so too does Craig Bellamy’s Melbourne Storm, a team that has been as relentless as a liquid metal Terminator ever since Bellamy – like Skynet becoming self-aware – took up the coaching reins ahead of the 2003 season.

For this reason the Cowboys have been anointed this season’s “fairytale team” – though there’s an argument that, even though they are not in the NRL, that title should be reserved solely for the PNG Hunters, who last week won the Queensland Cup and will feature on the NRL grand final undercard when they face NSWRL grand final winners Penrith. As for the Cowboys, fairytale team or not, it’s only now, after all they’ve done these past few weeks, that we’re beginning to take more notice of who is in their lineup rather than who isn’t.

              "bodyTextSummary": "A controversial study suggesting that doping in sport is far more prevalent than was found to be by conventional testing has finally been published after years of wrangling. The research, based on anonymous surveys carried out at two elite athletics competitions in 2011, found that up to 57% of competitors admitted doping in the previous 12 months, a figure far surpassing the 1-2% identified by blood and urine tests carried out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), and higher even than the 14% prevalence estimated from the athlete biological passport. But the research, commissioned and funded by Wada, has taken almost six years to be officially published, despite the results being leaked to the New York Times in 2013 and later released in the UK under parliamentary privilege by the culture, media and sport committee on blood doping in athletics. Giving evidence at the inquiry into blood doping in athletics in 2015, Sebastian Coe, president of the IAAF, said that the delay was down to issues surrounding the researchers’ methodologies. However Rolf Ulrich, first author of the study from the University of Tübingen, pushed back, accusing the IAAF of blocking the release of the study and co-authoring a response to the committee arguing that the delay and comments from Coe and his colleague Thomas Capdevielle were damaging to the authors’ reputations, efforts to combat doping, and scientific freedom. Indeed the authors, who could not publish without consent from Wada, told the Guardian that they were left in the dark as to the reason for the delay. “I really can’t answer [why it took so long],” said Ulrich. “I have no idea.” Paul Dimeo, an expert in drug use in sport from the University of Stirling, who was not involved in the research, said the delay was bordering on scandalous. “This information should have been transparent and made available much, much sooner,” he said. “It is a well-established methodology, it has been used in numerous other studies which have also shown prevalence to be quite high – some of them have shown it to be 20-40% in other places,” he added.

But the statement issued by the body also noted that traditional testing was only one approach used to catch cheats. “Wada is constantly looking at ways and means to further enhance the effectiveness of the fight against doping in sport for the benefit of clean athletes,” it stated. Now published in the journal Sports Medicine, the research reveals how athletes were quizzed at the 13th International Association of Athletics Federations World Championships in Athletics (WCA) in South Korea and the 12th Quadrennial Pan-Arab Games in Qatar (PAG) – both of which took place in 2011. The survey used a method known as the “randomised response technique”. At the start of the survey, the participant was asked to think of the date of birth of someone they knew. The participant was then given two further questions simultaneously on the same screen. If the birthday fell in the first 10 days of a month, they were asked to answer a trivial question, but if it fell in the latter part of the month they were asked to answer whether they had used a prohibited substance or method in the last 12 months. The upshot is that participants were able to answer honestly without fear of identification, with the overall proportion of athletes who answered each question judged based on statistical probabilities of when birthdays fall. That, say the researchers, offers a way to estimate the proportion of athletes who said they had broken anti-doping regulations in the previous year. The results from 1,203 athletes at the WCA and 965 athletes at the PAG suggests that levels of doping could be far higher than traditional tests suggest. The researchers found that more than 43% of athletes quizzed at WCA had doped in the past year, with the figure reaching just over 57% for those at PAG. By contrast biological tests at the events found a prevalence of just 0.5% at WCA and under 4% at PAG. “The big question is, how sure can we be that athletes were actually compliant and they understood and they followed the instructions and answered as they were told?” said Andrea Petróczi, co-author of the research from Kingston University. Taking into account the possibility that some responders might have answered in error, possibly from not reading the question properly due to their high speed of response, the team estimate that at least 30% of athletes at WCA and 45% of those at PAG doped in the last year. The authors also explored a host of scenarios under which the athletes might not have answered the doping question truthfully, or otherwise not complied. “In the great majority of those different scenarios it turns out we would have undershot the actual value,” said Harrison Pope Jr, a co-author of the study from Harvard University, adding that that suggests doping was likely more prevalent than the results suggest.

                    "html": "<p>A controversial study suggesting that doping in sport is far more prevalent than was found to be by conventional testing has finally been published after years of wrangling.</p> \n<p>The research, based on anonymous surveys carried out at two elite athletics competitions in 2011, found that up to 57% of competitors admitted doping in the previous 12 months, a figure far surpassing the 1-2% identified by blood and urine tests carried out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), and higher even than the 14% prevalence estimated from the athlete biological passport.</p> \n<p>But the research, commissioned and funded by Wada, has taken almost six years to be officially published, despite the results being leaked to the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/23/sports/research-finds-wide-doping-study-withheld.html?_r=0\">New York Times</a> in 2013 and later <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/WADA&apos;s-athlete-doping-prevalence-survey.pdf\">released in the UK under parliamentary privilege</a> by the culture, media and sport committee on blood doping in athletics.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/culture-media-and-sport-committee/combatting-doping-in-sport/written/28187.html\">Giving evidence</a> at the inquiry into blood doping in athletics in 2015, Sebastian Coe, president of the IAAF, said that the delay was down to issues surrounding the researchers’ methodologies.</p> \n<p>However Rolf Ulrich, first author of the study from the University of Tübingen, pushed back, accusing the IAAF of<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/16/athletics-body-iaaf-accused-blocking-survey-revealing-widespread-doping\"> blocking the release of the study</a> and co-authoring a <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/documents/commons-committees/culture-media-and-sport/Correspondence/Letter-from-University-of-Tubingen-regarding-blood-doping-11-January-2016.pdf\">response</a> to the committee arguing that the delay and comments from Coe and his colleague Thomas Capdevielle were damaging to the authors’ reputations, efforts to combat doping, and scientific freedom.</p> \n<p> Indeed the authors, who could not publish without consent from Wada, told the Guardian that they were left in the dark as to the reason for the delay.</p> \n<p>“I really can’t answer [why it took so long],” said Ulrich. “I have no idea.”<br /></p> \n<p>Paul Dimeo, an expert in drug use in sport from the University of Stirling, who was not involved in the research, said the delay was bordering on scandalous. </p> \n<p>“This information should have been transparent and made available much, much sooner,” he said. “It is a well-established methodology, it has been used in numerous other studies which have also shown prevalence to be quite high – some of them have shown it to be 20-40% in other places,” he added.</p> \n<p>Wada said that its working group on prevalence will convene next month to further explore the scale of the issue, looking both at the latest study and other research. But the statement issued by the body also noted that traditional testing was only one approach used to catch cheats. “Wada is constantly looking at ways and means to further enhance the effectiveness of the fight against doping in sport for the benefit of clean athletes,” it stated.</p> \n<p>Now published in the journal <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-017-0765-4\">Sports Medicine</a>, the research reveals how athletes were quizzed at the 13th International Association of Athletics Federations World Championships in Athletics (WCA) in South Korea and the 12th Quadrennial Pan-Arab Games in Qatar (PAG) – both of which took place in 2011.</p> \n<p>The survey used a method known as the “randomised response technique”. At the start of the survey, the participant was asked to think of the date of birth of someone they knew. The participant was then given two further questions simultaneously on the same screen. If the birthday fell in the first 10 days of a month, they were asked to answer a trivial question, but if it fell in the latter part of the month they were asked to answer whether they had used a prohibited substance or method in the last 12 months. <br /></p> \n<p>The upshot is that participants were able to answer honestly without fear of identification, with the overall proportion of athletes who answered each question judged based on statistical probabilities of when birthdays fall. </p> \n<p>That, say the researchers, offers a way to estimate the proportion of athletes who said they had broken anti-doping regulations in the previous year.</p> \n<p>The results from 1,203 athletes at the WCA and 965 athletes at the PAG suggests that levels of doping could be far higher than traditional tests suggest. The researchers found that more than 43% of athletes quizzed at WCA had doped in the past year, with the figure reaching just over 57% for those at PAG. By contrast biological tests at the events found a prevalence of just 0.5% at WCA and under 4% at PAG.</p> \n<p>“The big question is, how sure can we be that athletes were actually compliant and they understood and they followed the instructions and answered as they were told?” said Andrea Petróczi, co-author of the research from Kingston University.</p> \n<p>Taking into account the possibility that some responders might have answered in error, possibly from not reading the question properly due to their high speed of response, the team estimate that at least 30% of athletes at WCA and 45% of those at PAG doped in the last year.</p> \n<p>The authors also explored a host of scenarios under which the athletes might not have answered the doping question truthfully, or otherwise not complied. “In the great majority of those different scenarios it turns out we would have undershot the actual value,” said Harrison Pope Jr, a co-author of the study from Harvard University, adding that that suggests doping was likely more prevalent than the results suggest. </p> \n<p>Pope said he was not surprised by the figures, adding that: “It is critical for people to know the sheer magnitude of this problem.”</p> \n<p>“Even though the paper refers to events that happened in 2011, there is no particular reason to think the rates of doping in 2017 would be any different,” he added. “The urgent thing at this point is for subsequent studies using this [method] to be conducted now in elite sports to track this problem.”</p> \n<p>John Hoberman, an expert in performance-enhancing drug use from the University of Texas at Austin, said that he wasn’t surprised by the findings. “The entire elite global sports system has built incentives to dope into itself in such a way that these are irresistible incentives,” he said.</p> \n<p>While Dimeo welcomed the research he said that one limitation of the study did not differentiate between athletes who might have smoked cannabis once in the past 12 months, and those on intensive doping programmes.</p> \n<p>Nicole Sapstead, chief executive of UK Anti-Doping, described the findings as “disappointing and concerning statistics”, but she said many things had changed since 2011, including stiffer sanctions. “Testing methods continue to advance but testing is only one part of the anti-doping process,” she said. “There is now greater investment in educating elite and up and coming athletes about the dangers and consequences of taking banned substances, as well as a greater emphasis on intelligence and investigations as an alternative way of catching those who seek to break the rules.”</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for the Athletics Integrity Unit, an independent board <a href=\"https://www.iaaf.org/news/press-release/independent-athletics-integrity-unit\">set up by the IAAF this year</a> with Thomas Capdevielle its the interim head, said that the body would not comment on the specific findings or accuracy of the study, but that the research was welcome. <br /></p> \n<p>“The AIU is in no doubt that the percentage of athletes doping in the sport of athletics is significantly above the number of adverse analytical findings currently reported in annual global anti-doping figures,” it said in a statement.<em> </em></p> \n<p>Don Catlin, one of the pioneers of modern drug-testing, said the study showed doping was far more prevalent than conventional tests suggest. “The long question of ‘how good is drug testing?’ is pretty much answered by this paper,” he said, adding that the study was a game-changer. <br /></p> \n<p>South African sports scientist Ross Tucker said the research showed the authorities needed to do more. <br /></p> \n<p>“The study seems to be as robust and accurate as you’ll get,” he added. “It’s certainly a lot more reliable than doing anti-doping testing to identify dopers. It also puts the ball into anti-doping’s court. They have to now respond. Not sure how they do that, but the more this stuff is in the open, the better.”</p> \n<p>Jim McVeigh, director of the Public Health Institute at Liverpool John Moores University, said that the implications of the research go far beyond elite sport. “While there are a range of health risks that these athletes are being exposed to, this also sends a concerning message to the general population – that using drugs is an effective or even necessary route to sporting success,” he said.</p> \n<p><br /></p>"

                    "html": "<p>The boss of Amazon’s television production arm has hinted that the company is planning significant expansion into sports broadcasting.</p> \n<p>Roy Price, the head of Amazon Studios, said at the Edinburgh international television festival that sport was a good opportunity for Amazon’s video streaming service.</p> \n<p>The comments suggest Amazon could compete to win rights to show Premier League matches when the next auction launches next year.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/01/amazon-outbids-sky-to-win-exclusive-atp-tour-tennis-rights\">Amazon recently won the rights to broadcast the ATP World Tour, the main men’s tennis tour</a>. These rights are currently held by Sky and allow it to show the end-of-year ATP World Tour finals, won by Andy Murray last year at the O2 arena in London.</p> \n<p>“People love sports – it’s big, it’s engaging, it really motivates people, so I think that’s a good opportunity,” Price said. “I think it’s definitely an opportunity we’ll explore.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/aug/11/premier-league-broadcast-battle-hots-up-as-sky-face-doling-out-extra-600m\">City analysts have already warned that Sky could be forced to pay an extra £600m </a>annually to retain the lion’s share of Premier League matches because of potential competition from Google, Apple, Facebook and Netflix as well as Amazon. </p> \n<p>The rights are split between Sky and BT at present, with Sky paying almost £4.2bn for the majority of matches in the last three-year deal.</p> \n<p>Price refused to provide more details about what Amazon may bid for or its expansion plans in sport.<br /></p> \n<p>The Amazon boss also praised the success of the Grand Tour, the motoring show featuring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May. “I would take four more of those [type of shows] any day,” he said.</p> \n<p>Price suggested Amazon could eventually sell the rights to the Grand Tour to broadcasters around the world to show as a repeat, raising the prospect of Clarkson returning to terrestrial television in Britain.</p> \n<p>Amazon underlined its ambitions in TV by announcing significant new shows at Edinburgh. These include Carnival Row, a fantasy noir starring Orlando Bloom as a police inspector investigating the murder of a faerie showgirl. The series will feature eight episodes and will be released in 2019.</p> \n<p>Price said Amazon was keen for more big shows and that Game of Thrones, HBO’s fantasy epic, had changed the TV industry.</p> \n<p>“Game of Thrones<em> </em>to me is to television what Jaws was to movies after the 70s,” he said. “Jaws and Star Wars<em> </em>came out and set an example. I think one thing that’s an example of is thinking out of the box and making it bigger and more cinematic and having bigger budgets. Bigger world, bigger budgets – that’s something I would anticipate throughout the marketplace.</p> \n<p>“I think everybody wants to have one of the top 10 shows, one of the top five shows. That’s really what matters most. I think [Game of Thrones] set a good example and has really gone above and beyond in terms of delivering a big world with high stakes and everybody gets behind it.</p> \n<p>“I think as people focus on getting in the top five and the top 10 some of the constraints will fall away – in terms of cast, who participates and how much you spend.”</p> \n<p>Price, who was speaking to Channel 4’s chief creative officer, Jay Hunt, also denied that the rise of Amazon, Netflix and other services meant there was too much TV.</p> \n<p>“I think there’s a lot of great TV,” he said. “I don’t find the world is running out of ideas, so I’m not sure I relate to that, or maybe I don’t understand it. But I’ve heard it many times – we can’t make any more peak TV.”</p>"

                    "html": "<p>What it hasn’t had a chance to do yet, however, is make great literature. Look at any list of the greatest sports books of all time and you will struggle to find a female protagonist represented. Female athletes have been written about in some perfectly commendable biographies, but there is no classic of sporting reportage that captures the essence of female competition in the manner of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/feb/05/fiction.oliverburkeman\" title=\"\">Norman Mailer</a>’s <em>The Fight</em>. Nor has a fictional writer ever elevated women’s sport to the intellectual heights of, for instance, the baseball novels of Don DeLillo (<em>Underworld</em>), Bernard Malamud (<em>The Natural</em>) or Philip Roth (<em>The Great American Novel</em>).</p> \n<p>No, sporting women have not yet received their true due between the book covers. That’s not to say they’re absent, or unwelcome when they do appear. Lionel Shriver’s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/may/07/fiction.features1\" title=\"\"><em>Double Fault</em></a> – a novel virtually unknown until its successor, the Orange prize-winning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/17/lionel-shriver-we-need-talk-kevin\" title=\"\"><em>We Need to Talk about Kevin</em></a>, made Shriver’s name – contains a brilliant characterisation of a young tennis star who has given everything up for her sporting career. The film <em>Million Dollar Baby</em> couldn’t have scooped seven Oscars if it hadn’t first appeared among FX Toole’s excellent collection of boxing stories.</p> \n<p>Even PG Wodehouse, who captured cricket and golf with fun and flair, understood that women could be as sport-obsessed as men. In his short story “Jane Gets off the Fairway”, a wayward wife is shocked back into marital fidelity when she realises that her young son, whose grip she has been neglecting, is holding his club incorrectly: “Now there he was, grasping the club as if it had been a spade … She shuddered to the very depths of her soul.”</p> \n<p>Wodehouse also invented Honoria Glossop, whose heartiness intimidates her sometime fiance Bertie Wooster; you can trace a path from Honoria to the jolly-hockey-sticks antics of Enid Blyton’s schoolgirl characters. The tomboy trend was gaining ground in the 1930s and 40s, and heroines such as Darrell Rivers, the lacrosse-playing head girl of Malory Towers, were defying convention on the playing fields. Few were as barrier-breaking as the protagonist of Enid Bagnold’s 1935 book <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/apr/06/national-velvet-enid-bagnold-rereading\" title=\"\"><em>National Velvet</em></a>. More than 80 years ago, Velvet achieved in fiction something still unmatched in real life when she rode the Piebald to victory and became the first female jockey to win the Grand National. She also managed it in her teens.</p>"

A half-century before the Williams sisters fought their way from the streets of Compton to fame and fortune, Gibson was blazing a path from Harlem to Wimbledon, and Schoenfeld uses her friendship with another outsider – her Jewish doubles partner Angela Buxton – to weave a story of perseverance and triumph against sexism and racism.</p> \n<p>A tale like Gibson’s is a reminder of how much we have missed out on by favouring male narratives for so long. It took until 1995 for Joan Ryan’s <em>Little Girls in Pretty Boxes</em>, an exposé of the brutal training regimes in gymnastics and figure skating, prevalent in the 80s and early 90s, to be published. And one of last year’s most moving and inspiring books about sport was <em>Find a Way</em>, the memoir of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/10/endurance-swimmer-diana-nyad-its-about-steel-trap-mind\" title=\"\">Diana Nyad</a>, who at 64 became the first person to swim the shark-infested waters from Cuba to Florida – after failing at three previous attempts.</p> \n<p>The London Olympics was a watershed in women’s sport; for the past five years, it has been taken more seriously than ever before by the public, the media and, in some cases, its own governing bodies. In the 80s, the most high-profile literary sporting heroines were the sex-addled showjumpers and pushy polo players you found in<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/15/mount-by-jilly-cooper-review\" title=\"\"> Jilly Cooper’s jodhpur sagas</a>.</p> \n<p>Last year a number of history books highlighted the importance of women in sport: they should surely herald a new age of literature about sport itself.</p> \n<p>• Emma John’s <em>Following On: A Memoir of Teenage Obsession and Terrible Cricket</em> is out in paperback from Wisden.

              "bodyTextSummary": "England captain Heather Knight predicted her team’s historic world cup victory will transform the face of cricket in Britain after a pulsating finale at Lord’s in front of the largest crowd ever to watch a women’s game in this country. More than 27,000 spectators piled into the home of cricket, many of them women and young girls, to witness one of the most remarkable comebacks ever seen at Lord’s, led by 25-year-old Anya Shrubsole. With an estimated TV audience of more than 100 million watching as they capitalised on an India collapse, Knight, Shrubsole and their teammates will be propelled to new levels of fame and recognition, in the form of improved sponsorship and advertising deals. As Knight lifted the trophy and thanked a boisterous crowd, still in place 20 minutes after the finish, there was a sense that this could be a groundbreaking summer for women’s sport. Johanna Konta’s rousing run to the Wimbledon semi-finals set the tone and England’s football team are among the favourites for Euro 2017, before the rugby World Cup takes centre stage next month. Both Knight and Shrubsole said afterwards they had been inspired by visits to Lord’s while they were still in primary school. Many young girls were in attendance yesterday, including a team from New Hall school in Chelmsford who visited the commentary box. Knight said she hoped the spectacle would be a gamechanger. “I really think it will be transformative,” she said, “There’s never been a better time to be a young girl in cricket and what a time to start playing. A lot of girls on the team took inspiration from men’s cricketers or older brothers or their dads, but what a spectacle today was. Hopefully it gets a few more girls inspired and playing the game. I know the England and Wales Cricket Board are in a great position to capitalise on our win and I’m sure they will.”\nShrubsole won it for England with a faultless performance. The 25-year-old took five wickets in 19 balls as England came back from the brink to beat India and claim the trophy for a fourth time. “For a while it looked like we were out of it, but that’s the beauty of this team,” said Shrubsole, “We never give up. It’s been a brilliant World Cup. “It’s a dream you never think comes true. To come back to a venue where I first came in 2001 and leave as a World Cup winner is amazing.” There was devastation for India, who had been set 229 to win. Chasing runs and a historic first World Cup victory, they were cruising towards victory at 191-3 but Shrubsole pinned Poonam Raut lbw for 86 to spark a collapse of seven wickets for 28 runs. India needed 11 runs from 12 balls as the match reached its nerve-shredding climax. But Shrubsole intervened with another emphatic wicket to send the England fans inside Lord’s wild. By 9am the queue to enter the grounds was already beyond the perimeter fence and down to Wellington Road, abuzz with excitement as a ticket tout appealed for spares. As one spectator wryly observed: “A few years ago you couldn’t give tickets away to women’s cricket, now there’s touts outside. That’s the measure of how far it’s come.” With the most expensive tickets priced at £30, there were more young families in attendance than the usual Lord’s crowd, many children experiencing this evocative sporting arena for the first time. Keen to capitalise on the hype, the International Cricket Council (ICC) were dispensing free plastic bats to children and there were opportunities to try out bowling in a tent beside the practice pitch. At the on-site Lord’s museum there was a steady stream of visitors throughout the day. The Flamingos, an under-11 girls team from Buenos Aires, were shown a blue ball, designed specially for women in the late 19th century because it was believed they would be too scared by a red ball. Before play began there was another reminder of how far the women’s game has come; a minute’s applause in memory of Rachael Heyhoe Flint, her face beamed onto the scoreboards. A former England captain and pioneer, Heyhoe Flint conceived the idea of a World Cup over a bottle of brandy with philanthropist Sir Jack Hayward. On their way from the dressing room to the middle, Knight and her team passed under a picture of Heyhoe Flint in the Long Room. “I felt a bit emotional during the anthems when I saw her face,” said Knight. Until 1999 women were not allowed to be MCC members and could not even go into the pavilion unaccompanied. Although attitudes have modernised, the women’s national team are still down the pecking order when it comes to playing at the home of cricket. The final was only the 16th time the England women’s team have played here in 41 years, since their first appearance in 1976. The young spinner Alex Hartley, who has perhaps been the revelation of the tournament for England, plays for Middlesex – whose home is Lord’s – but has never actually played or even practised here. The White Stripes’ Seven Nation Army was booming around Lord’s as the teams made their way out, the only spare seats being in the members’ pavilion. England got an ideal start, winning the toss and opting to bat. But England lost three for 16 with opener Lauren Winfield, Tamsin Beaumont and Knight going in quick succession. Sarah Taylor, possibly the most mercurial talent in the team and Nat Sciver helped England rebuild with a fourth wicket partnership of 83. It was a below par innings and India were favourites at the interval. England’s dreams of victory looked to be ebbing away when Raut was batting brilliantly as India chased 229 to win. But when the 27-year-old opener fell lbw to Shrubsole for 86 the wheels came off. There was a collective gasp around Lord’s as Jenny Gunn dropped a sitter at the death which looked to have ended England’s chances. There was little sympathy for Gunn from captain Knight afterwards. “It felt like she’d dropped the World Cup,” she said, “but we managed to get over the line so that’s the main thing.”",
