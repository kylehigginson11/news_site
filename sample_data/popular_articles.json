I struggled growing up with the feeling that the monarchy were fundamental to Britishness, but that the Britishness they represented was one that excluded me. </p> <p>This exclusion mattered. It made other people perceive being truly British, and being black, as incompatible identities. It represented a giant taboo.

However, the future princess has been critical of the US president, branding him “misogynistic”.</p> \n<p>The prospect of Trump attending the ceremony is an unlikely one. With the level of protection that surrounds an American president, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event.</p> \n<p>Trump’s appearance could also spark mass protests.</p> \n<p>When Theresa May offered Trump an early invite for a state visit, the decision proved controversial with polls suggesting up to two million people would take to the streets to demonstrate should the trip go ahead.</p> \n<p>In 2011, the then US president, Barack Obama, and the first lady, Michelle Obama, were not invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, reportedly because of the added security cost. But they were feted with a state visit to the UK a month later.</p> \n<p>Should Trump travel to the UK for a state visit, it would be expected that the newly royal Markle would meet him and join guests at the state banquet. But Markle, who backed Hillary Clinton for president, suggested in a television interview in 2016 that she would leave the US for Canada if Trump won.</p> \n<p>She said: “We film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada. I mean come on, if that’s reality we are talking about, come on, that is a gamechanger in terms of how we move in the world here.”</p> \n<p>Markle told Larry Wilmore’s Nightly Show in the US: “Yes, of course Trump is divisive.</p> \n<p>“Think about just female voters alone. I think it was in 2012, the Republican party lost the female vote by 12 points. That’s a huge number and as misogynistic as Trump is and so vocal about it, that’s a huge chunk of it.”</p> \n<p>For the 1981 wedding of Harry’s parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, Ronald Reagan did not attend but his wife, Nancy Reagan, did. This could be an option for Harry, who has already met the current first lady, Melania Trump.</p> \n<p>The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be expected to receive one of the sought-after invites, along with other Commonwealth leaders from across the globe.</p>"

                    "html": "<p>In this context, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2017/nov/27/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-engagement-live-updates\" title=\"\">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</a>’s engagement represents something genuinely different from everything that has gone before. Their marriage will bring into reality what the British establishment lacked the imagination to even conceive of as possible 17 years ago – that a senior royal can love, and marry, someone whose ethnic heritage is not just different to his own, but the heritage that has always been most othered in Britain – black and African.</p> \n<p>The royal family plays a largely symbolic role in our society, so it’s the symbolism of this engagement that interests me. I struggled growing up with the feeling that the monarchy were fundamental to Britishness, but that the Britishness they represented was one that excluded me. This exclusion mattered. It made other people perceive being truly British, and being black, as incompatible identities. It represented a giant taboo. Every government that I can remember made some attempt, rhetorical at least, to acknowledge and protect racial diversity. The family at the apex of our society was doing anything but.</p> \n<p>That’s hardly surprising, given that the very concept of the royal family is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/02/prince-harry-britain-race-royals\" title=\"\">the very antithesis of diversity</a>.</p> \n<p>But now the hypocrisy that flourished for so long in the dark is emblazoned by the light of social media. Minutes after the royal engagement was announced, the Daily Mail, in a tone of reassurance, instantly reminded the nation that Markle will not join the line of succession. “Marrying into royalty does not earn you a right to the throne”, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DailyMailUK/status/935088542803484674\" title=\"\">tweeted the newspaper</a>. Thank GOD for that. <a href=\"https://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2017/11/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-the-union-of-royalty-and-showbiz/\" title=\"\">The Spectator saw fit to point out</a>: “Obviously, 70 years ago, Meghan Markle would have been the kind of woman the Prince would have had for a mistress, not a wife.”</p> \n<p>What “kind of woman” is that? It’s not just that she’s divorced. Markle’s race has been the subject of such frequent and cryptic references that when I first read about her, having never seen her before, I had genuinely no idea what the commentators were on about. “Not in the society blonde style” of Harry’s relationships past, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3896180/Prince-Harry-s-girlfriend-actress-Meghan-Markles.html\" title=\"\">we were told</a>, and “Straight Outta Compton!”. Typically dog-whistle British code for the fact that she had black ancestry - a code which Harry took the remarkable step of calling out in <a href=\"https://www.royal.uk/statement-communications-secretary-prince-harry\" title=\"\">a statement condemning</a> the tone of press coverage.</p> \n<p>Since the royal family are such a quintessentially British institution, it’s fitting that our uniquely British dysfunction around race and identity should also emerge in response to Markle’s arrival on the scene. One of the problems with the discourse in Britain today is the tendency to downplay racial difference, and the temptation of so many well-meaning people who “don’t see race” to believe that if we can all just wilfully blind ourselves, it will hopefully go away.</p> \n<p>By contrast, Markle has owned and expressed pride in her heritage, speaking at length about the experience of having black heritage in a prejudiced society; of seeing her mother abused with the “N” word, of <a href=\"http://www.ebony.com/entertainment-culture/meghan-markle-suits-interview#ixzz4OfhWqZnC\" title=\"\">working in a highly racialised</a> industry as an actor, and <a href=\"http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/news/a26855/more-than-an-other/\" title=\"\">the identity struggle</a> to which so many people who grow up as visible minorities can relate.</p> \n<p>As a mixed-race woman, the narrative around Markle has extra layers of complexity. Some black commentators have pointed out that, since she is fair-skinned and conforms to Eurocentric ideas of beauty, even the symbolic impact of her presence <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kza_xo/status/935104069814968321\" title=\"\">is limited</a>. Meanwhile white commentators continue to feed into the idea that mixed-race people are a kind of desirable variety of black – Vogue editor Alexandra Shulman for example recently suggesting that there is a “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/nov/10/former-vogue-editor-alexandra-shulman-find-idea-that-there-was-a-posh-cabal-offensive\" title=\"\">perfect type of mixed race</a>”, something to which no doubt Markle would also conform.</p>"

In a society where race and class often collide to delineate privilege and opportunity, few will find their lives transformed in real terms by the arrival of a beautiful American actress in Kensington Palace.</p> \n<p>But we live in times defined also by identity. In recent years, the question of what it means to be British has been weaponised and politicised in new ways. Markle is, on one side of her family, directly descended from the plantation slavery of America’s Deep South - a history with which all of Britain’s powerful families, including the royals, are inextricably linked. He may not have realised it at the time, but by condemning the press reaction to his relationships with Markle, Prince Harry was aligning himself with those still dealing with the fallout of that history, and its very real legacy today.</p> \n<p>If Prince Harry had wanted to find a way to make his role more relevant in modern Britain, he could have done a lot worse. And so while neither the reaction to his engagement to Markle, nor the reaction to the reaction, could ever have been planned, if engagements are meant to bring people together, this one is doing just that.</p> \n<p>• Afua Hirsch is a writer and broadcaster</p>"

She said:</li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it is true that the reports they are handing over have already been redacted or edited, this would be against the spirit and the letter of parliament’s motion.It would show once again how desperate ministers are to hide the facts about Brexit from parliament and the public. </p> <p>The select committee must be given the analyses which were completed and nothing less. We cannot and should not be short-changed. The public and parliament must no longer be kept in the dark.</p> </blockquote> <p>A spokesman for the Brexit department said it had done what parliament requested. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have always been clear that our analysis does not exist in the form parliament requested. We have taken time to bring together the analysis we do have in a way that meets parliament’s specific ask. Our overall programme of work is comprehensive, thorough and is continuously updated.

As the Press Association reports, he said that while a deal could not be finalised until the UK had actually withdrawn from the EU, the preparations would take place “in parallel” with the Brexit negotiations.

              "bodyTextSummary": "The Brexit department has handed over to the Commons Brexit committee internal government reports about the impact of Brexit on different sectors of the economy as commanded by a Commons vote. (See 4.33pm and 5.30pm.) But the information does not consist of the 58 separate sectoral impact assessments MPs were expecting and the Labour MP Seema Malhotra, who sits on the committee, said David Davis, the Brexit secretary, would face further “embarrassment and defeat” in the Commons if it turned out that the documents had been edited in an effort to keep MPs in the dark. She said: If it is true that the reports they are handing over have already been redacted or edited, this would be against the spirit and the letter of parliament’s motion.It would show once again how desperate ministers are to hide the facts about Brexit from parliament and the public. The select committee must be given the analyses which were completed and nothing less. We cannot and should not be short-changed. The public and parliament must no longer be kept in the dark. A spokesman for the Brexit department said it had done what parliament requested. He said: We have always been clear that our analysis does not exist in the form parliament requested. We have taken time to bring together the analysis we do have in a way that meets parliament’s specific ask. Our overall programme of work is comprehensive, thorough and is continuously updated. This sectoral analysis is simply one part of it. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, has said that the EU27 are united behind Ireland in wanting “more progress” on the border issue in the Brexit talks before being willing to open negotiations on a future UK-EU trade relationship. (See 11.56am.) The new defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, was put on notice in the Commons that he will face a substantial Tory revolt if a national security review leads to major cuts in the armed services. Britain and Turkey have begun work on a post-Brexit free trade agreement, the Turkish prime minister has disclosed. Following talks in Downing Street with Theresa May, Binali Yildirim said the two countries had set up a joint working group which met for the first time earlier this month. As the Press Association reports, he said that while a deal could not be finalised until the UK had actually withdrawn from the EU, the preparations would take place “in parallel” with the Brexit negotiations. He said: These will take place simultaneously. It is not like we will first wait for the UK to finish Brexit and then see what happens. That is not the kind of approach we have in mind. That would be wrong. Work has already started on it and it has to start. This way we will make sure that, in a gradual manner, we will be paving the way into a free trade agreement and we need to finish the necessary preparations before that time. Both parties are aware of the significance of this joint working group and we have been taking the necessary steps with this aim in mind. Richard Leonard, the new Scottish Labour leader, has signalled in his first major speech on policy that he wants to see higher taxes on wealthy property owners to fund public services. That’s all from me for today. Thanks for the comments.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "The latest Guardian/ICM polling is out - and it has mixed messages for the government. The budget has not boosted the Conservatives’ lead over Labour on the economy. Theresa May and Philip Hammond are still comfortably ahead of Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell on this measure, but their lead is smaller now, after the budget, than it was last month. Respondents were asked, irrespective of which party they support, which team they thought was best able to manage the economy properly. The results were: Theresa May and Philip Hammond: 36% (down 3 from Guardian/ICM one month ago) Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell: 28% (up 2) Neither: 26% (up 3) Conservative lead: 8 points (down 5) We also asked the “Brexit bill” that the UK is due to pay to the EU when it leaves. We first asked about this in April, when some people were suggesting the amount the UK ends up paying could be as low as £3bn. Now it is has been reported that Theresa May is in principle willing to pay up to £40bn, although ministers seem to want to make that conditional on getting a good response from the EU on trade.

Here are the results: £10bn Acceptable: 50% (up 9 from Guardian/ICM in August) Not acceptable: 32% (down 8) £20bn Acceptable: 28% (up 10) Not acceptable: 54% (down 11) £30bn Acceptable: 14% (up 3) Not acceptable: 67% (down 5) £40bn Acceptable: 11% (up 2) Not acceptable: 71% (down 4) Support for paying a minimal “Brexit bill” to the EU when the UK leaves has gone up over the last three months. In August only 41% thought paying £10bn was acceptable. That has now risen to 50%, and even support for much larger payments has risen slightly. But voters are strongly opposed to paying a “Brexit bill” on the scale planned by ministers. Only 11% of respondents said a £40bn payment would be acceptable, even though it has been widely reported in recent days that this is what ministers think will be necessary. Some 71% of respondents said paying that amount would be unacceptable. Finally, here are the ICM state-of-the-party polling figures. The budget has failed to boost the Conservatives’ popularity, the poll suggests. It has the Conservatives and Labour both on 41%, exactly where they were two weeks ago. Labour: 41% (no change from Guardian/ICM two weeks ago) Conservatives: 41% (no change) Lib Dems: 7% (no change) Ukip: 5% (up 1) Greens: 3% (up 1) I will post a link to the tables here, as soon as they go up on the ICM website.

What detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: The combination of falling apprenticeship starts and restricted access to skilled labour after Brexit will cripple the industrial strategy. What is being announced today is not much more than a reinvention of the wheel. We’ve had an industrial strategy already for five years. But there is a big cloud hanging over it now caused by the major uncertainties around Brexit. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said: Nine in 10 firms see a modern Industrial Strategy as vital to improving living standards in the face of Brexit uncertainty and a sombre economic outlook. This announcement shows the government has its eye firmly on the horizon, not just the next few yards. We welcome the recognition that success will require urgent action in partnership with business. This is the route to raising living standards in every corner of the country.",

Coveney said: They have repeated the message that Ireland’s problems are the EU’s problem, so Ireland is not going to be isolated and forced to use a veto. We are part of an EU negotiating team that is very clear on this issue - there needs to be more progress on the Irish issues between now and the 14th of December and if that doesn’t happen we won’t be moving on to the phase two discussions, which is where everybody wants to be, including Ireland. We can’t allow a situation to develop where we move into phase two of discussions on Brexit in the hope that somehow the border is going to be resolved without having any credible understanding as to how that’s going to be done. Coveney said that the “full picture” regarding the UK’s future trade relationship with the EU would only become clear when the Brexit talks moved on to cover trade.

But of course, when you come down to agriculture and smaller items, I don’t think technology would work. </p> \n <p>One thing we do not want, can’t have, is back to a physical border.</p> \n <p>Theresa May, take her at her word, she’s confidently said she doesn’t want a physical border, the EU don’t want a physical border, the Irish Government don’t. </p> \n <p>So you’re left down with the one alternative - to make technology work in most cases and to throw a blind eye to those areas that can’t come in within technology.</p> \n</blockquote>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "Richard Leonard, the new Scottish Labour leader, is to greatly overhaul his party’s policies and closely align its strategies with Jeremy Corbyn’s approach at Westminster, in a clear break from the stance taken by his predecessor Kezia Dugdale. After winning a convincing victory in the Scottish leadership contest, Leonard has announced he plans to set up 12 policy reviews covering areas such as council funding, housing, children’s health, climate change and renewables, as well as a commission on tax reform. His credentials as Corbyn’s preferred candidate were underlined after Corbyn pledged he “would as closely as possible” with Leonard, who was backed heavily by the unions, at a joint appearance in Glasgow on Monday morning. In an implicit criticism of Scottish Labour’s previously centrist positioning and its distaste for fully-fledged Corbynism under Dugdale, Corbyn stressed the case for unity between the UK and Scottish parties. “Now our whole party and movement must campaign together to inspire people in every nation and region of the UK to have the confidence to be a country that genuinely cares for all,” Corbyn said in an advance text. Leonard offered some overtures to his party’s centrists by name-checking John Smith, the former UK party leader and moderate whose sudden death in 1994 led to Tony Blair’s election as leader, and paying tribute to his centrist rival for the post, Anas Sarwar. Lauding Corbyn’s “principles, policies and integrity”, Leonard said: Together, we can seize the day and, as John Smith said when he became Labour leader, ‘persuade millions of the strength of our vision, the relevance of our policies and the urgency of our demand for change’. Labour has changed, and now we are determined to change Scotland. That is our task today; it is one I am confident that we can achieve together.",

Harry, wearing a navy blue suit and matching tie, said he was “thrilled, over the moon”.

The prime minister’s spokesman said: “There are no plans for a bank holiday. There isn’t precedent in this area. There was no bank holiday for Prince Andrew’s wedding in 1986 or Prince Edward’s in 1999.”</p> <p>However, the wedding of Princess Anne, the Queen’s second-eldest child, and Mark Phillips in 1973 was marked by a bank holiday. </p> <p>The ceremony is likely to be conducted by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who said he was delighted by the news and had been impressed by Harry’s “immense love for his family”.<br /></p> <p>Harry’s brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate, said: “We are very excited for Harry and Meghan.

The prince, 33, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/nov/08/prince-harry-lambasts-press-over-meghan-markle-coverage\">spoke out</a> about the way Markle, who is divorced, was portrayed when news of the relationship became public just over a year ago. <br /></p> <p>He condemned some of the newspaper reports and comment pieces as racist – Markle, 36, is of mixed race – and sexist. His spokesman criticised the “racial undertones of comment pieces” and referred to “the nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers”.</p> <p>Among the headlines that were believed to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/a-wave-of-abuse-how-prince-harrys-relationship-announcement-meghan-markle-attacked-the-press\">angered the palace</a> was one on Mailonline.com that read: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton”, referring to the city in Los Angeles that has become known for gang violence.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7628d5afdb3bebe6f4e41dedb653fb66c11cb689\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7628d5afdb3bebe6f4e41dedb653fb66c11cb689/0_109_2269_1361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wave after posing for the media\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle wave after posing for the media.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alastair Grant/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Harry also complained of “a smear on the front page” of the Sun, which ran still images of Markle in the television drama Suits appearing on Pornhub, an adult website. It was headlined “Harry girl’s on Pornhub” even though what was posted were clips of intimate scenes from the programme, and not pornography.<br /></p> <p>The news sparked a torrent of vitriol against Markle on Twitter and other social media platforms as well as in public comments below online news stories. </p> <p>Markle has spoken of her heritage as a source of pride. “My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American,” she has said in the past. “To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.”</p> <p>Harry is understood to have told his close staff two weeks ago that he wanted to make the engagement public, and planning has been under way since then. </p> <p>The delay in announcement was partly due to Markle needing to finish filming on Suits, which she completed the week before last. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2450e83c671fff69ea9b5bfd1375a3461c9f86f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2450e83c671fff69ea9b5bfd1375a3461c9f86f4/0_76_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists film Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Kensington Palace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists film Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at Kensington Palace on Monday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Ansell/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like her fiance, Markle has been involved in humanitarian work. She has travelled to Rwanda as a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and has worked as a women’s advocate for the UN.<br /></p> <p>Her parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, said in a statement on Monday: “We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry. Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Prince Harry has said he is “thrilled” after announcing that he is to marry the American actor Meghan Markle next spring. Congratulations have flooded in for the couple, who appeared in public for a photoshoot at Kensington Palace on Monday afternoon, hours after making their engagement public. Holding hands, the couple spoke briefly. Harry, wearing a navy blue suit and matching tie, said he was “thrilled, over the moon”. He declined to give details about the engagement, which happened this month in London, but joked: “Of course it was romantic.” Asked when he knew Markle was “the one”, he said: “The very first time we met.” Markle, wearing a white wrap coat, displayed her engagement ring and said she was “so very happy”, rubbing Harry’s arm affectionately as the couple smiled for the cameras.\nThe couple will move into a two-bedroom Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace after the wedding. The announcement of their engagement was made by Clarence House on behalf of Prince Charles earlier on Monday. Later, the Prince of Wales, speaking for himself and the Duchess of Cornwall, said: “We’re both thrilled. We hope they’ll be very happy indeed.”\nThe Queen, Prince Philip, the prime minister, Theresa May, and Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, were among others who offered their congratulations. Downing Street moved quickly to dampen speculation that there would be a bank holiday to celebrate the wedding. The prime minister’s spokesman said: “There are no plans for a bank holiday. There isn’t precedent in this area. There was no bank holiday for Prince Andrew’s wedding in 1986 or Prince Edward’s in 1999.” However, the wedding of Princess Anne, the Queen’s second-eldest child, and Mark Phillips in 1973 was marked by a bank holiday. The ceremony is likely to be conducted by Justin Welby, the archbishop of Canterbury, who said he was delighted by the news and had been impressed by Harry’s “immense love for his family”. Harry’s brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate, said: “We are very excited for Harry and Meghan. It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and to see how happy she and Harry are together.”\nDetails of the venue and timing of the wedding are expected to be released on Tuesday, with aides saying only that it will be “a happy church wedding”. March is the most likely month, leaving enough time to ensure Kate is not about to give birth to her third child.\nNews of the wedding will prompt a media frenzy that is likely to further test Harry’s relationship with the press. The prince, 33, spoke out about the way Markle, who is divorced, was portrayed when news of the relationship became public just over a year ago. He condemned some of the newspaper reports and comment pieces as racist – Markle, 36, is of mixed race – and sexist. His spokesman criticised the “racial undertones of comment pieces” and referred to “the nightly legal battles to keep defamatory stories out of papers”. Among the headlines that were believed to have angered the palace was one on Mailonline.com that read: “Harry’s girl is (almost) straight outta Compton”, referring to the city in Los Angeles that has become known for gang violence.\nHarry also complained of “a smear on the front page” of the Sun, which ran still images of Markle in the television drama Suits appearing on Pornhub, an adult website. It was headlined “Harry girl’s on Pornhub” even though what was posted were clips of intimate scenes from the programme, and not pornography. The news sparked a torrent of vitriol against Markle on Twitter and other social media platforms as well as in public comments below online news stories. Markle has spoken of her heritage as a source of pride. “My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American,” she has said in the past. “To say who I am, to share where I’m from, to voice my pride in being a strong, confident mixed-race woman.” Harry is understood to have told his close staff two weeks ago that he wanted to make the engagement public, and planning has been under way since then. The delay in announcement was partly due to Markle needing to finish filming on Suits, which she completed the week before last.\nLike her fiance, Markle has been involved in humanitarian work. She has travelled to Rwanda as a global ambassador for World Vision Canada and has worked as a women’s advocate for the UN. Her parents, Thomas Markle and Doria Ragland, said in a statement on Monday: “We are incredibly happy for Meghan and Harry. Our daughter has always been a kind and loving person. To see her union with Harry, who shares the same qualities, is a source of great joy for us as parents. We wish them a lifetime of happiness and are very excited for their future together.” Thomas Markle is a former Emmy award-winning television lighting director who worked on shows including Married With Children and General Hospital. He married Ragland in 1979, but they divorced in 1988. Tennessee-born Ragland is a former TV makeup artist and lives in Los Angeles.\nMarkle and Harry were reportedly introduced by the consultant Markus Anderson in 2016. Their relationship became public after about six months. As well as the tone of the coverage of Markle, there have been complaints of harassment, a sensitive subject for Harry given the circumstances of his mother Princess Diana’s death 20 years ago. Kensington Palace protested last year at the “bombardment of nearly every friend, co-worker, and loved one in [Markle’s] life”. In September this year, in an interview with Vanity Fair, Markle spoke about her relationship with Harry, saying: “We’re two people who are really happy and in love. We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people’s perception.” In the same month, the couple made their first public appearance, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.\nA Buckingham Palace spokesman said the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh “are delighted for the couple and wish them every happiness”. May offered her “very warmest congratulations” to the couple. The prime minister said in a statement: “This is a time of huge celebration and excitement for two people in love and, on behalf of myself, the government and the country, I wish them great happiness for the future.” Corbyn said: “I hope they have a great time and great fun together, and having met Harry a couple of times I’m sure they’re going to have a great deal of fun.” The wedding will be the first involving a senior royal since William married Kate at Westminster Abbey on 29 April 2011.",

It strikes me the vital missing ingredient is the extent to which our attitudes to health and weight depend on our friendship groups, ages and jobs. A friend I train with at the gym plays weekly five-a-side football with his mates and says they’re all fit and take their health and fitness seriously. None are overweight.</p> \n<p>Most of my friends are middle aged like me. As we have got older, we’ve become much more concerned about our weight and general health and fitness. Still, there’s usually some sort of catalyst before embarking on a weight loss and exercise regime. We all knew and understood the health messages, but needed a spur to action before taking them seriously.</p> \n<p>For one, for whom diabetes runs in his family, it was coming last in the dads’ race at his son’s school sports day that spurred him to take action. Another friend was prescribed medication for high blood pressure and started to lose weight to help better manage his condition. A friend who freelances for a living said his spur was the need to look youthful and in good physical shape when pitching for projects, in order to radiate vitality and demonstrate capacity to cope with the slog. For another mate, it was simply the approach of a significant birthday, and with it a bit of taking stock.</p> \n<p>My catalyst was the kindness of male friends, by which I mean they took the mickey out me for being fat and unfit. In my late 30s and early 40s my weight had increased slowly. By my mid-40s it had jumped from a lithe 12 stone to a porky 15.5, and was showing no signs of stopping there. Long hours at my desk and client networking concentrated around eating and drinking, combined with little routine exercise had caught up with me. A health check at the doctor’s told me I was at risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>"

For eight months, out went all booze, bread, pasta, rice and sugary treats such as chocolate, biscuits and cake. In came running, regular trips to the gym with a personal trainer, smaller food portions and lots more fruit and salads. The weight fell off.</p> \n<p>We all agree that media messages encouraging us to eat healthily and exercise on the whole have gone in.

Have the men got trousers with a willy outline on them?<br /></strong><em>A Thompson, by email</em></p> <p>After exhaustive research, Ms Thompson, I can tell you conclusively that no, men are not walking around wearing trousers illustrated with willies or even symbols of willies (aubergines, chipolatas, etc, etc). Women, however, are so overwhelmed with what I guess we must call breast-themed shirts they can barely swing a bra without hitting one. Indeed, one could go as far as saying breast-themed shirts are currently the biggest trend on the high street, with shirts featuring drawings of actual breasts, or <a href=\"https://www.spreadshirt.co.uk/nice+melons+t-shirts-A19705769\">a pair of melons</a>, <a href=\"http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/product/clothing-427/t-shirts-6864659/oui-non-slogan-short-sleeve-striped-t-shirt-7149850?bi=20&amp;ps=20\">or hearts</a> <a href=\"http://www.asos.com/asos-curve/asos-curve-t-shirt-with-sequin-fried-eggs/prd/6803874\">or fried eggs</a> currently on sale pretty much everywhere in this county. Indeed, one could say that breasts are HUGE in fashion this season, unless your breasts are not huge, in which case don’t worry, would madam like a T-shirt decorated with a pair of fried eggs? Ha – breasts! Hilarious!<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2017/nov/13/clothes-harvey-weinsteins-wife-sexual-harrassment-georgina-chapmans-label-marchesa-promotional-wiles\">Is it OK to wear clothes made by Harvey Weinstein’s wife?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let’s just straight away knock on the head any suggestion that this trend is some kind of ironic Benny Hill feminist statement, OK? By all means, love your breasts, ladies. Be proud of them, unleash them from their restrictive lingerie and walk down the street with them swinging free, if it so pleases you, feeling your nipples nuzzle happily against your clothes. But reducing your magnificent bosoms to nudge-nudge wink-wink emojis is not the way to celebrate them, so let’s not pretend that this trend is anything other than attention-seeking to the most shameless degree. “Ha ha! Look at my melons! Geddit! GEDDIT???”</p> <p>Women still, too often, have to fight for men to look up and into their eyes when talking to them; why actively encourage them to stare back down as they happily decode the visual pun on your chest? And why tell people that actually, yes, you love being reduced to your breasts and even people giving your breasts stupid food-based nicknames? Honestly, this is some hot nonsense. You’re better than this. Your breasts should not be the first thing people think of when looking at you any more than your bellybutton should be. Stop reducing yourselves to a single part of your anatomy. As Ms Thompson says, the menfolk don’t do this – and while I fully accept that saying “Do what the men do, ladies” is not the most feminist order one could make, in this case, a mighty exception is being made.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84ed676430d19dbdfa2c75d0365f5af273643635\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84ed676430d19dbdfa2c75d0365f5af273643635/163_84_2704_3379/800.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell in PJs.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naomi Campbell in PJs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>WTF is with the trend with wearing pyjamas in the day?<br /></strong><em>Charlotte, north London</em></p> <p>Given that I am writing this in my pyjamas at 11.06am, I’m going to assume that you mean pyjamas as genuinely sanctioned daywear and not just being lazy (look, I’m really ill, OK?). Pyjamas have, indeed, become daywear; at least pyjamaesque clothes have, anyway, if not actual pyjamas. Because what would be the point of that? Pity the poor manufacturers, constantly having to think of ways to make people buy new clothes. After all, even they know there are only so many shirts and dresses and trousers a person can own, hence the occasional deranged proclamation of an entirely new item you absolutely must have in your wardrobe. Two years ago, for instance, the decree was issued that women should wear <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/style/trend-for-swimwear-as-daywear/\">“swimwear as daywear”</a>, but this did not mean it was OK to go out in that manky bikini you bought from Accessorize in Luton airport five years ago. No, it meant you had to go out and buy a £250 bathing suit from one of those fancy boutiques in Notting Hill or somewhere similar that never seem to have any customers in them and that you strongly suspect might be a front for money laundering.</p> <p>Which brings us back to the pyjamas-for-daywear trend. Obviously, you should not wear your actual pyjamas out of the house – that would look insane! (Except on weekends, when you are totally allowed to wear them under a coat to pop to the newsagent for emergency milk/bread/newspapers. That is an official rule, all debates on this subject can now desist.) But you should absolutely spend <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/gallery/pyjama-pj-dressing-gallery-shopping-list\">£395 on fancy pyjamas</a> and go out in those, because nothing makes a woman seem closer to sanity than spending almost £400 on a pair of PJs, right?</p> <p>I love pyjamas. Whenever I go back to the US, I always make sure to restock on my two life essentials: Twizzlers and J Crew pyjamas. On extra good days, I find ones with fancy embroidery on the breast pocket, which are the absolute best because they make me feel like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vftf8TTve4s\">Sesame Street’s Alistair Cookie</a>, Cookie Monster’s homage to a certain Brit, who is a long-term fashion icon of mine.</p> <p>I also love any fashion trend that actively endorses comfort.

              "bodyTextSummary": "My daughter and I were in Topshop the other week and saw a T-shirt with a pair of breasts drawn on the front. Have the men got trousers with a willy outline on them? A Thompson, by email After exhaustive research, Ms Thompson, I can tell you conclusively that no, men are not walking around wearing trousers illustrated with willies or even symbols of willies (aubergines, chipolatas, etc, etc). Women, however, are so overwhelmed with what I guess we must call breast-themed shirts they can barely swing a bra without hitting one. Indeed, one could go as far as saying breast-themed shirts are currently the biggest trend on the high street, with shirts featuring drawings of actual breasts, or a pair of melons, or hearts or fried eggs currently on sale pretty much everywhere in this county. Indeed, one could say that breasts are HUGE in fashion this season, unless your breasts are not huge, in which case don’t worry, would madam like a T-shirt decorated with a pair of fried eggs? Ha – breasts! Hilarious!\nLet’s just straight away knock on the head any suggestion that this trend is some kind of ironic Benny Hill feminist statement, OK? By all means, love your breasts, ladies. Be proud of them, unleash them from their restrictive lingerie and walk down the street with them swinging free, if it so pleases you, feeling your nipples nuzzle happily against your clothes. But reducing your magnificent bosoms to nudge-nudge wink-wink emojis is not the way to celebrate them, so let’s not pretend that this trend is anything other than attention-seeking to the most shameless degree. “Ha ha! Look at my melons! Geddit! GEDDIT???” Women still, too often, have to fight for men to look up and into their eyes when talking to them; why actively encourage them to stare back down as they happily decode the visual pun on your chest? And why tell people that actually, yes, you love being reduced to your breasts and even people giving your breasts stupid food-based nicknames? Honestly, this is some hot nonsense. You’re better than this. Your breasts should not be the first thing people think of when looking at you any more than your bellybutton should be. Stop reducing yourselves to a single part of your anatomy. As Ms Thompson says, the menfolk don’t do this – and while I fully accept that saying “Do what the men do, ladies” is not the most feminist order one could make, in this case, a mighty exception is being made.\nWTF is with the trend with wearing pyjamas in the day? Charlotte, north London Given that I am writing this in my pyjamas at 11.06am, I’m going to assume that you mean pyjamas as genuinely sanctioned daywear and not just being lazy (look, I’m really ill, OK?). Pyjamas have, indeed, become daywear; at least pyjamaesque clothes have, anyway, if not actual pyjamas. Because what would be the point of that? Pity the poor manufacturers, constantly having to think of ways to make people buy new clothes. After all, even they know there are only so many shirts and dresses and trousers a person can own, hence the occasional deranged proclamation of an entirely new item you absolutely must have in your wardrobe. Two years ago, for instance, the decree was issued that women should wear “swimwear as daywear”, but this did not mean it was OK to go out in that manky bikini you bought from Accessorize in Luton airport five years ago. No, it meant you had to go out and buy a £250 bathing suit from one of those fancy boutiques in Notting Hill or somewhere similar that never seem to have any customers in them and that you strongly suspect might be a front for money laundering. Which brings us back to the pyjamas-for-daywear trend. Obviously, you should not wear your actual pyjamas out of the house – that would look insane! (Except on weekends, when you are totally allowed to wear them under a coat to pop to the newsagent for emergency milk/bread/newspapers. That is an official rule, all debates on this subject can now desist.) But you should absolutely spend £395 on fancy pyjamas and go out in those, because nothing makes a woman seem closer to sanity than spending almost £400 on a pair of PJs, right? I love pyjamas. Whenever I go back to the US, I always make sure to restock on my two life essentials: Twizzlers and J Crew pyjamas. On extra good days, I find ones with fancy embroidery on the breast pocket, which are the absolute best because they make me feel like Sesame Street’s Alistair Cookie, Cookie Monster’s homage to a certain Brit, who is a long-term fashion icon of mine. I also love any fashion trend that actively endorses comfort. Athleisure? Normcore? Mom jeans? You’re talkin’ my language. So while my head wants to love the idea of pyjamas as daywear, my heart cannot accept it. Partly because I know, deep down, as you know, Charlotte, deep down, that it looks absurd. But mainly because my pyjamas are way too nice to spoil by being worn out of the house or even, God forbid, on public transport. They should be saved for the best place of all: bed.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Young adults will have retirement incomes similar to today’s pensioners, according to analysis which rejects widespread pessimism about the financial prospects for millennials.

It said that while pensioner incomes have risen sharply this century to match or even surpass those of working people, these levels can be broadly maintained in the future. The upbeat assessment is in sharp contrast to other a stream of reports which paint Britain’s pensions as among the worst in the developed world, with young workers facing penury in retirement. Resolution said “auto enrolment”, the government scheme in which workers are automatically defaulted into paying into a private pension scheme, will be the chief driver behind a recovery in pension income. But the thinktank acknowledged that today’s younger generation are unlikely to build up the housing wealth acquired by baby boomers – people born between the early 1940s and mid-1960s – from the huge increase in house prices, and will not be entitled to a state pension until they are older than the current generation of retirees. David Finch, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: “Rising pensioner incomes has been one of the biggest living standards success stories this century.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Bitcoin has hit a record high after passing $9,000 (£6,700) and is close to reaching five figures as investors in the cryptocurrency shrug off warnings of a bubble. The cryptocurrency rose to an all-time high of $9,721 on Monday. It is now worth more than seven times an ounce of gold, which is seen as a haven in times of turmoil. In a remarkable rally, bitcoin started the year at $1,000 and smashed through $5,000 in October.\nAnalysts said the decision by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) to launch bitcoin futures in December had fuelled buying, but also warned of the dangers of a speculative bubble building. The digital currency has gained more than 50% since the CME announced its decision on 31 October.

With no intrinsic value to bitcoin, it’s hard to see this as anything other than a giant speculative bubble.”\nBitcoin is a virtual currency that emerged in the aftermath of the financial crisis. It allows people to bypass banks and traditional payment processes to pay for goods and services.

Many hedge funds have also decided to include it in their portfolios and, according to CNBC, the financial news service, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/there-are-now-more-than-120-hedge-funds-focused-solely-on-bitcoin.html\">there are more than 120 funds investment devoted to cryptocurrencies</a>. </p> \n<p>Sayed said it was almost impossible to give the cryptocurrency a fair value based on fundamentals, but added that there had been a strong correlation between the price of bitcoin and number of users opening new wallets.</p> \n<p>He added: “Given that number of users haven’t exceeded 0.1% of the global population, there’s still more potential for this momentum trade to continue. Whether the price will be justified in the foreseeable future, depends on the adoption and the application of the new currency, but so far it still looks unstoppable.”</p> \n<p>The starkest warning has come from the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a fraud that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\">ultimately blow up</a>. </p> \n<p>There has been a boom in initial coin offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched into the market – often backed by a celebrity, such as the American socialite<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/paris-hilton-deletes-support-of-controversial-ico-2488431883.html\"> Paris Hilton</a> and the boxing champion <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/paris-hilton-backs-ico-lydian-celebrities-endorsing-cryptocurrencies-2017-9\">Floyd Mayweather</a>.</p> \n<p>ICOs have come under increased scrutiny from regulators, owing to fears that investors are not properly protected. David Futter<strong>, </strong>a<strong> </strong>partner in the digital economy at the law firm Ashurst,<strong> </strong>predicts that scrutiny will intensify.</p> \n<p>“Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge, but have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved. </p> \n<p>“If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.”<br /></p> \n<p>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> •</p>"

Markle did not make her first comments about the relationship until September – 10 months after the initial statement – and they were not even seen together until 25 September, when they were photographed at the Invictus Games, a sporting event for injured soldiers set up by the prince.\nMarkle’s comments were made to Vanity Fair magazine, rather than UK newspapers. She revealed they had met in London through friends in July 2016 and were now really happy and in love. She said scrutiny of the couple since their relationship became public had its challenges but that she had not changed. “We’re a couple. We’re in love,” she said. “I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time.” The moment to present their stories has now arrived. However, the prince and Markle still seem determined to do it on their own terms. Photographs of the engaged couple were taken in an carefully organised photocall and the only interview they gave was to the BBC’s Mishal Husain, which was then shared with other broadcasters. Nonetheless, as their own relationship takes the next step, so will their relationship with the media.",

The prince encouraged the press regulator to order Mail Online to publish the ruling against it at the top of its website, which it did.<br /></p> \n<p>Markle did not make her first comments about the relationship until September – 10 months after the initial statement – and they were not even seen together until 25 September, when they were photographed at the Invictus Games, a sporting event for injured soldiers set up by the prince.</p>"

She revealed they had met in London through friends in July 2016 and were now really happy and in love. She said scrutiny of the couple since their relationship became public had its challenges but that she had not changed. “We’re a couple. We’re in love,” she said. “I’m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time.”</p> \n<p>The moment to present their stories has now arrived. However, the prince and Markle still seem determined to do it on their own terms. Photographs of the engaged couple were taken in an carefully organised photocall and the only interview they gave was to the BBC’s Mishal Husain, which was then shared with other broadcasters.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/27/prince-harry-to-marry-meghan-markle\">their own relationship takes the next step</a>, so will their relationship with the media.</p>"

Suddenly there has been a resurgence of the big beasts. Stick a pin anywhere in the terrestrial schedules at the moment and you’re likely to find an A-list celebrity chef roaring out of the woodwork to show these anaemic youngsters what they’re missing. Jamie’s there. Nigella’s there. Rick’s there. Paul and Mary are both there, snarling at each other across the channels like a pair of scorned ex-lovers. But life is full and nobody has time to watch them all, so here’s a quick ranking of all the big cookery shows, ordered from worst to best.</p> <h2><strong>5. Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast, Channel 4</strong></h2> <p>Are you an absolute lad? Do you enjoy legendary bantz? Do you tend to greet things by bellowing “woy-oy” at the sky? Then you’ll love Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast, a sort of witless culinary Top Gear that nobody watches because it’s on when its target audience is busy pre-gaming for a big night out. Or maybe nobody watches it because sitting through a single episode is like being pinned down and forcibly injected with a concentrated dose of Jamie Oliver’s worst impulses. Nobody even knows why Jamie and Jimmy’s Friday Night Feast is even a thing. The assumption is that Jamie’s farmer friend forced him into making it via some sort of elaborate blackmail scheme, but that’s pure conjecture at this point.</p> <h2><strong>4. Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets, BBC One</strong></h2> <p>In Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets, Berry interminably stalks around some National Trust property or other before going into its kitchen and whipping up an anonymous puddle of flaccid beige-grey pre-metric almost-food. I have never felt the last vestiges of life drain from my body while trapped at the bottom of a well, but I imagine that watching Mary Berry’s Country House Secrets is a close enough comparison.</p> <h2><strong>3. Paul Hollywood: A Baker’s Life, Channel 4</strong></h2> <p>This, you have to admit, is not particularly well timed. Hollywood’s image has taken a battering over the last year, from his eagerness to ditch the rest of the GBBO gang and hop channels to the recent break-up of his marriage via his pathological midlife infatuation with big red cars. Ideally, now is not the time to air the “I’m just a humble baker, welcome to my story” series he presumably got handed as a sweetener for staying with Bake Off. And that’s a shame because it isn’t bad. Once you cut away all the nonsense, Hollywood remains a skilled baker and a decent communicator, and this show would be incredibly watchable if it came at a time when he wasn’t largely perceived as the swaggering poster boy for obnoxious bellendry.</p> <h2><strong>2. Rick Stein’s Road to Mexico, BBC Two</strong></h2> <p>Usually, this would be flat last. Usually, Rick Stein’s culinary travelogues are unbearable because all he ever does is visit a well-known tourist trap, patronise the locals senseless and then complain because Britain doesn’t have the exact same customs as wherever he happens to be. However – and this might be down to his age, or down to my own ludicrous tendency to project – Road to Mexico is actually quite sweet. Stein seems less like an ugly foreigner here and more a man slightly adrift in the world. When he talks about visiting San Francisco after the summer of love because he heard a radio discussion about burritos, or when he says “no problemo” immediately after arriving in Mexico, his benign Alan Partridge tendencies come into focus like never before. It absolutely isn’t perfect, but it’s an improvement.</p> <h2><strong>1. Nigella Lawson: At My Table, BBC Two</strong></h2> <p>At My Table isn’t just a good Nigella Lawson series; I’d argue it’s the defining Nigella Lawson series. She has been on television for almost 20 years, and now she has relaxed into herself like never before. She’s no longer constrained by the infantilising “totty” tag that followed her around for years, plus she has given up her irksome tendency to look normal by riding around on a hired bus full of extras. Now she’s free to be who you suspect she’s always been; a dotty posho who is just as likely to plonk herself on the stairs in her nightie and tell you some mad story about something a woman screamed at her in hospital as cook any actual food. This new persona suits her. I hope it stays.</p>",

When he talks about visiting San Francisco after the summer of love because he heard a radio discussion about burritos, or when he says “no problemo” immediately after arriving in Mexico, his benign Alan Partridge tendencies come into focus like never before. It absolutely isn’t perfect, but it’s an improvement.</p> \n<h2><strong>1. Nigella Lawson: At My Table, BBC Two</strong></h2> \n<p>At My Table isn’t just a good Nigella Lawson series; I’d argue it’s the defining Nigella Lawson series. She has been on television for almost 20 years, and now she has relaxed into herself like never before. She’s no longer constrained by the infantilising “totty” tag that followed her around for years, plus she has given up her irksome tendency to look normal by riding around on a hired bus full of extras. Now she’s free to be who you suspect she’s always been; a dotty posho who is just as likely to plonk herself on the stairs in her nightie and tell you some mad story about something a woman screamed at her in hospital as cook any actual food. This new persona suits her. I hope it stays.</p>"
