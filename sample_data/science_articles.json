While the original version of Crispr snips DNA in precise locations to delete faulty genes or over-write flaws in the genetic code, the modified form “turns up the volume” on selected genes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"98857eca-db45-46a8-a2c6-08a4ffcb1a00\"         data-atom-type=\"qanda\"    > </gu-atom> </figure>   <p>This potentially overcomes the problem of the wrong genes being modified by mistake, so-called off-target effects, which is viewed as a major safety barrier to using Crispr in a clinical context.</p> <p>“Cutting DNA opens the door to introducing new mutations,” said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, who led the latest work at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. “That is something that is going to stay with us with Crispr or any other tool we develop that cuts DNA. It is a major bottleneck in the field of genetics – the possibility that the cell, after the DNA is cut, may introduce harmful mistakes.”</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/oct/25/chemical-surgery-can-correct-genetic-mutations-behind-many-diseases-study\">'Chemical surgery' can correct genetic mutations behind many diseases – study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Crispr has been a game-changer in biomedical research because of the ease and accuracy with which it can be used to edit the genetic code. Crispr is a guide molecule made of RNA that allows a specific site on the genome to be targeted. It is normally used along with a bacterial enzyme, called Cas9, which acts as molecular scissors, chopping the DNA at the exact point required.</p> <p>In the new version a Crispr-style guide is still used, but instead of cutting the genome at the site of interest, the Cas9 enzyme latches onto it. The new package also includes a third element: a molecule that homes in on the Cas9 and switches on whatever gene it is attached to.</p> <p>The new paper, <a href=\"http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31247-3\">published in Cell</a>, demonstrates how this strategy might be applied to a range of devastating illnesses.</p> <p>The team showed that mice, with a version of muscular dystophy, a fatal muscle wasting disorder, recovered muscle growth and strength. The illness is caused by a mutation in the gene that produces dystrophin, a protein found in muscle fibres.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Incurable diseases such as diabetes and muscular dystrophy could be treated in future using a new form of genetic engineering designed to boost gene activity, according to scientists. The technique is an adapted version of the powerful gene editing tool called Crispr. While the original version of Crispr snips DNA in precise locations to delete faulty genes or over-write flaws in the genetic code, the modified form “turns up the volume” on selected genes.\nThis potentially overcomes the problem of the wrong genes being modified by mistake, so-called off-target effects, which is viewed as a major safety barrier to using Crispr in a clinical context. “Cutting DNA opens the door to introducing new mutations,” said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, who led the latest work at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. “That is something that is going to stay with us with Crispr or any other tool we develop that cuts DNA. It is a major bottleneck in the field of genetics – the possibility that the cell, after the DNA is cut, may introduce harmful mistakes.”\nCrispr has been a game-changer in biomedical research because of the ease and accuracy with which it can be used to edit the genetic code. Crispr is a guide molecule made of RNA that allows a specific site on the genome to be targeted. It is normally used along with a bacterial enzyme, called Cas9, which acts as molecular scissors, chopping the DNA at the exact point required. In the new version a Crispr-style guide is still used, but instead of cutting the genome at the site of interest, the Cas9 enzyme latches onto it. The new package also includes a third element: a molecule that homes in on the Cas9 and switches on whatever gene it is attached to. The new paper, published in Cell, demonstrates how this strategy might be applied to a range of devastating illnesses. The team showed that mice, with a version of muscular dystophy, a fatal muscle wasting disorder, recovered muscle growth and strength. The illness is caused by a mutation in the gene that produces dystrophin, a protein found in muscle fibres. However, rather than trying to replace this gene with a healthy version, the team boosted the activity of a second gene that produces a protein called utrophin that is very similar to dystrophin and can compensate for its absence. “We are not fixing the gene, the mutation is still there,” said Belmonte. “Instead ... the mice recover the expression of other genes in the same pathway. That is enough to recover the muscle function of these mutant mice.” In another mouse experiment, the team showed that normal kidney function could be restored in animals with a genetic kidney disorder. They were also able to induce some liver cells to turn into cells that somewhat resembled beta cells, the pancreatic cells that produce insulin, to improve the symptoms of mice with diabetes.

It’s not the friendly Potteries dialect, but something that sounds a little like the lovechild of French and German. A Tudor house here is home to the Esperanto Association of Britain (EAB), which encourages people to learn the constructed language.</p> <p>Esperanto summer schools were first established in Stoke in 1960, and were funded by the council for more than 50 years.

Learning the language isn’t just a hobby, but a commitment to making connections across borders on a level playing field.</p> \n<p>I initially write this off as simply a nice sentiment, but there’s plenty of practise behind the principle. O’Dunne shows me the Pasporta Servo, a pocket-sized directory of Esperantists all around the world. They offer fellow speakers a place to stay in their home country, often completely free of charge. For language enthusiasts under 25, the charity NoJef will pay for travel and accommodation for attendance at Esperanto-themed events.</p> \n<p>The Pasporta Servo led 26-year-old James McMurray, a data engineer from Crawley, to make learning Esperanto his New Year’s resolution several years ago. He had first became familiar with the language while leafing through his grandfather’s books – he had become an Esperantist while stationed in India during the second world war. “I remember growing up and seeing his books in Esperanto, without being able to understand it, and his correspondence with people all over the world who may not speak English and be able to communicate,” McMurray says. He has since attended Esperantist music events in France, and met up with fellow learners in Prague and Malaga. His first serious relationship started through a shared interest in Esperanto.</p>"

Partly to blame is repression throughout the 20th century by authoritarian regimes. Adolf Hitler condemned Esperanto in Mein Kampf as a “secret language” for Jewish plots, and even the very small minority of pro-fascist Esperanto speakers were targeted by the Nazi party.</p> \n<p>Mostly, however, it’s the omnipresence of English that explains why Esperanto isn’t the current go-to for international communication. Esperanto is “neutral” because it is not a national language, but that also means it does not have a state backing its use abroad. (For context, the British Council allocated more than £1bn last year to promote English-language education overseas.) “People having to make a choice will see English as the financially better option,” Kennedy says. “However, Esperanto gives you things that English will never be able to give you … [such as] a sense of belonging.” He credits the “accepting and caring” Esperanto-speaking community with helping him to overcome loneliness and bullying.</p> \n<p>Whether to learn a national language or a constructed one is a debate Kennedy has had with others. But one piece of advice from another Esperanto-speaker stayed with him: “Learn English if you want to make money; learn Esperanto if you want to make friends.” “It’s one of the truest things I’ve ever heard,” he says.</p>"

But details of the fossil’s provenance remain sketchy, since the specimen has spent years in private collections after it was illegally bundled out of Mongolia. It ended up in the hands of scientists, and is being returned to to its home country thanks to its most recent owner – collector and fossil dealer François Escuillié. The team of palaeontologists were so surprised by the creature that their first step was to make sure that it wasn’t a chimera made from a mash-up of fossils. Using a high resolution scanning technique that employs radiation produced by a particle accelerator known as a synchrotron, the team were able to explore the fossil even though it was still partially embedded in rock. The results, published in the journal Nature, not only showed that the remains were from just one creature, say the authors, but also revealed hidden details. Among the discoveries, the team note that the very front part of the animal’s snout has more teeth than any other dinosaur. “The shape [of the animal’s teeth] as well is very unusual, and that was the first evidence of the amphibious lifestyle, because really they look like crocodile teeth, because they are curved backwards” said Fernandez.

Named Halszkaraptor escuilliei after the late palaeontologist Halszka Osmolska and the collector Escuillié, the authors say the creature is not only a new species of dinosaur, but opens up a whole new sub-family, encompassing two other previously unearthed and unusual creatures. Despite its intriguing features, the new creature was not a bird but a primitive member of a group of non-avian theropod dinosaurs known as Dromaeosaurs, which includes velociraptors, says Fernandez. “It is a stunning fossil,” said Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study.

Fernandez also noted that while the claws are a feature thought to be useful on land, the other features would help with hunting fish. <br /></p> \n<p>“When we add up all the [characteristics] it shows that it was an amphibious animal – it was able to run on land, as we imagine dinosaurs running around, and on top of that it was able to go into water,” Fernandez said, adding that the creature’s body was about the size of a mallard duck, but with a long tail and longer legs. </p> \n<p>While early members of the group that includes modern birds show <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/jun/16/fossils.internationalnews\">signs of a water-based lifestyle</a>, the adaptations are very rare in non-avian dinosaurs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/dec/01/sauropod-footprint-find-makes-skye-scotlands-largest-dinosaur-site\">Sauropod footprints, made in lagoons, have been found in Scotland</a>, but only giant meat-eaters known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/sep/11/giant-predatory-dinosaur-spinosaurus-rivers\">spinosaurids</a> have previously been heralded as showing skeletal modifications that indicate a truly amphibious lifestyle.</p>"

It ended up in the hands of scientists, and is being returned to to its home country thanks to its most recent owner – collector and fossil dealer François Escuillié.<br /></p> \n<p>The team of palaeontologists were so surprised by the creature that their first step was to make sure that it wasn’t a chimera made from a mash-up of fossils.</p> \n<p>Using a high resolution scanning technique that employs radiation produced by a particle accelerator known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/feb/01/diamond-britain-large-hadron-collider-particle-accelerator\">a synchrotron</a>, the team were able to explore the fossil even though it was still partially embedded in rock.<br /></p> \n<p>The results, <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/nature24679\">published in the journal Nature</a>, not only showed that the remains were from just one creature, say the authors, but also revealed hidden details.</p> \n<p>Among the discoveries, the team note that the very front part of the animal’s snout has more teeth than any other dinosaur.</p> \n<p>“The shape [of the animal’s teeth] as well is very unusual, and that was the first evidence of the amphibious lifestyle, because really they look like crocodile teeth, because they are curved backwards” said Fernandez. The authors point out that a long neck is common in modern birds and reptiles that ambush prey in water, and that the curved teeth would help to trap the prey. <br /></p> \n<p>In addition, the creature had a neurovascular system in its snout similar to that seen in crocodiles, and a relatively short tail and skeletal features that mean it would have moved on land in a more upright stance than its close relatives – more akin to modern birds.</p> \n<p>Named <em>Halszkaraptor escuilliei</em> after the late palaeontologist Halszka Osmolska and the collector Escuillié, the authors say the creature is not only a new species of dinosaur, but opens up a whole new sub-family, encompassing two other previously unearthed and unusual creatures.<br /></p> \n<p>Despite its intriguing features, the new creature was not a bird but a primitive member of a group of non-avian theropod dinosaurs known as Dromaeosaurs, which includes velociraptors, says Fernandez.<br /></p> \n<p>“It is a stunning fossil,” said Stephen Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh who was not involved in the study. But, he said, despite the careful analysis by the authors, he has concerns. <br /></p> \n<p>“I just have some nagging doubts about whether the whole thing is one genuine skeleton,” he said, adding that while it is easy to spot a bad fake, modern tampering can be highly sophisticated. “The thing that piques my curiosity is that the body really looks like a dromaeosaur, a raptor dinosaur, and the head really looks like an alvarezsaur – that’s another type of small dinosaur.”</p> \n<p>While Brusatte added that it is both possible the fossil is genuine, and that the creature was amphibious, he pointed out that other theropods – and even modern animals like ostriches – had long, slender necks but didn’t hunt in the water. “I don’t see any slam-dunk evidence that this thing was semi-aquatic,” he said. “There is a long way to go to really prove it.” </p>"

So what is <em>Archaeopteryx </em>and why has this paper got palaeontologists (a bit) excited?</p> <h2><strong>What is Archaeopteryx?</strong></h2> <p>You will find a cast of <em>Archaeopteryx </em>or two, or a model reconstruction in almost every natural history museum and <em>Archaeopteryx</em> is, quite rightly, described in the new paper as an iconic fossil. However, from personal experience in talking to museum visitors, it is not an extinct animal that many people are familiar with, being not quite on the same tier of recognisability as large dinosaurs.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/dec/06/smuggled-fossil-very-weird-new-species-of-amphibious-dinosaur-halszkaraptor-escuilliei\">Smuggled fossil 'very weird' new species of amphibious dinosaur, say experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>First described in 1861, <em>Archaeopteryx lithographica </em>was the species name given to an isolated feather fossil, and later a fossilised feathered skeleton excavated from the lithographic limestone of Solnhofen in Germany. The Solnhofen limestone is one of the most widely known examples of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagerst%C3%A4tte\">Konservat-Lagerstätte</a>, a geological site of exceptional preservation. The discovery of the feather alone pushed the age of bird fossils back tens of millions of years, but the discovery and description of a the feathered skeleton could not have been better timed in the history of evolutionary biology, helping to build the iconic status of <em>Archaeopteryx</em>. </p> <h2><strong>Icon of Evolution</strong></h2> <p>Discovered just two years after the publication of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/feb/09/darwin.bestseller\">Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection</a>, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, <em>Archaeopteryx </em>ruffled feathers (boom boom) from the off. The fossil skeleton of <em>Archaeopteryx </em>showed typical reptilian features but also appeared to be covered in feathers. The discovery was met with incredulity by palaeontologists of the time, to whom the fixed nature of species was a long-ingrained idea. Feathers were firmly a characteristic of birds and could not be found associated with a reptile. Some scientists doubted the fossil until they saw it; others proposed that the structures superficially resembled feathers but were something else. Even renowned anatomist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen\">Richard Owen</a> played down or ignored problematic reptile characteristics such as teeth in the skull and the anatomy of the limbs. The reason why the timing of the discovery couldn’t have been better timed is because many scientists were still debating Darwinian ideas of the transformation of species over time. For opponents, like Richard Owen, an almost perfect example of an “intermediate form” between birds and “saurians” like <em>Archaeopteryx </em>was problematic. Whether or not <a href=\"https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/museums/2014/01/23/is-archaeopteryx-a-bird-or-not/\"><em>Archaeopteryx</em> was a bird</a> has been debated almost ever since, and very little else about this animal has been settled on. Amusingly, the Guardian fell foul of the <em>Archaeopteryx </em>bird-or-not<em> </em>curse with <em>Archaeopteryx </em>being “<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/jul/27/oldest-bird-archaeopteryx-study\">knocked off its perch</a>” in July 2011 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/oct/26/archaeopteryx-bird-family-tree\">subsequently re-perched in October</a> of the same year. </p> <p>It’s a quirk of the history of discovery that <em>Archaeopteryx </em>has become a fulcrum for debates around evolution, the fixity of archetypes in animal groups and whether it’s a bird or the earliest true bird fossil. It’s only discoveries of other feathered reptiles, dino-birds and feather-like structures in reptiles in recent decades which have opened up the research in this area. It’s tempting to imagine how evolutionary biology may be completely different today had <em>Archaeopteryx </em>never been discovered exactly when it was. Would Richard Owen and allies have drawn out the acceptance of evolution without <em>Archaeopteryx </em>as a poster specimen for evolution (albeit not in the way we now understand it)? Because <em>Archaeopteryx </em>is an icon of evolution it’s also a target for creationists and there’s no doubt that the re-evaluation of this specimen will be hitting the print-on-demand creationist presses soon as yet further proof of the great palaeontological conspiracy or whatever it is we’re supposedly up to. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/28/baby-bird-amber-fossil-feathers\">Hot fuzz: the baby bird fossil that gives new meaning to ancient feathers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Following the discovery and description of the feather and first skeleton, over the years a number of other specimens came out of Solnhofen and one other locality and each gained a nickname, normally based on the museum they ended up in. After a long campaign to secure the specimen, the first skeleton ended up in the Natural History Museum London and became known as the London specimen. A second skeleton, the Berlin specimen, was discovered in 1876 and described in 1884. The Maxberg specimen, currently missing, was found in 1956. The Haarlem specimen was found in 1855 but not described until 1973. The Eichstätt specimen was found in 1951 and described in 1973. The mysterious Solnhofen specimen, original locality unknown, was described in 1988. The Munich specimen was discovered in 1992 and described in 1993. A further six specimens have been found since the late 1990s including a specimen held in a private collection and one specimen still awaiting scientific description. </p> <p>These twelve specimens are all that is known about <em>Archaeopteryx, </em>and plenty of questions remain unanswered. A number of different identifications have been suggested, the number of species of <em>Archaeopteryx </em>is debated and size ranges across the known specimens have been posited as different developmental stages. </p> <p>Whether <em>Archaeopteryx </em>was capable of true flight has also been the subject of much debate in the literature. Controversy around the origin, loss and rediscovery of some specimens means that interpreting the geographical, geological and temporal range of this species or group of species is also difficult. Twelve skeletons and a feather separated by thousands or tens of thousands of years in the geological record is an extremely limited data set to draw many firm conclusions from. Now, that list may be eleven skeletons and a feather thanks to the paper published this week: Re-evaluation of the Haarlem <em>Archaeopteryx </em>and the radiation of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs (Foth &amp; Rauhut 2017). </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"abce570aabfa563ee8ecef8618e009395877b51b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/abce570aabfa563ee8ecef8618e009395877b51b/0_0_891_842/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Haarlem specimen.

Proportions of the fossil bones present were distinct from <em>Archaeopteryx. </em>The presence of furrows on both sides of the phalanges (fingers) is a character shared with theropod dinosaurs <em>Anchiornis </em>and <em>Eosinopteryx </em>from China<em>. </em>This specimen is distinct from both of those in the small size of the claw.

              "bodyTextSummary": "A paper published earlier this week in BMC Evolutionary biology suggests that one of only 12 known Archaeopteryx fossil skeletons is not in fact an Archaeopteryx at all but a new species of theropod dinosaur, Ostromia crassipes. One Dutch newspaper, perhaps over-egging it slightly, went as far as likening the discovery to finding out that your Monet painting turned out to be a Van Gogh. So what is Archaeopteryx and why has this paper got palaeontologists (a bit) excited? What is Archaeopteryx? You will find a cast of Archaeopteryx or two, or a model reconstruction in almost every natural history museum and Archaeopteryx is, quite rightly, described in the new paper as an iconic fossil. However, from personal experience in talking to museum visitors, it is not an extinct animal that many people are familiar with, being not quite on the same tier of recognisability as large dinosaurs.\nFirst described in 1861, Archaeopteryx lithographica was the species name given to an isolated feather fossil, and later a fossilised feathered skeleton excavated from the lithographic limestone of Solnhofen in Germany. The Solnhofen limestone is one of the most widely known examples of a Konservat-Lagerstätte, a geological site of exceptional preservation. The discovery of the feather alone pushed the age of bird fossils back tens of millions of years, but the discovery and description of a the feathered skeleton could not have been better timed in the history of evolutionary biology, helping to build the iconic status of Archaeopteryx. Icon of Evolution Discovered just two years after the publication of Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, Archaeopteryx ruffled feathers (boom boom) from the off. The fossil skeleton of Archaeopteryx showed typical reptilian features but also appeared to be covered in feathers. The discovery was met with incredulity by palaeontologists of the time, to whom the fixed nature of species was a long-ingrained idea. Feathers were firmly a characteristic of birds and could not be found associated with a reptile. Some scientists doubted the fossil until they saw it; others proposed that the structures superficially resembled feathers but were something else. Even renowned anatomist Richard Owen played down or ignored problematic reptile characteristics such as teeth in the skull and the anatomy of the limbs. The reason why the timing of the discovery couldn’t have been better timed is because many scientists were still debating Darwinian ideas of the transformation of species over time. For opponents, like Richard Owen, an almost perfect example of an “intermediate form” between birds and “saurians” like Archaeopteryx was problematic. Whether or not Archaeopteryx was a bird has been debated almost ever since, and very little else about this animal has been settled on. Amusingly, the Guardian fell foul of the Archaeopteryx bird-or-not curse with Archaeopteryx being “knocked off its perch” in July 2011 and subsequently re-perched in October of the same year. It’s a quirk of the history of discovery that Archaeopteryx has become a fulcrum for debates around evolution, the fixity of archetypes in animal groups and whether it’s a bird or the earliest true bird fossil. It’s only discoveries of other feathered reptiles, dino-birds and feather-like structures in reptiles in recent decades which have opened up the research in this area. It’s tempting to imagine how evolutionary biology may be completely different today had Archaeopteryx never been discovered exactly when it was. Would Richard Owen and allies have drawn out the acceptance of evolution without Archaeopteryx as a poster specimen for evolution (albeit not in the way we now understand it)? Because Archaeopteryx is an icon of evolution it’s also a target for creationists and there’s no doubt that the re-evaluation of this specimen will be hitting the print-on-demand creationist presses soon as yet further proof of the great palaeontological conspiracy or whatever it is we’re supposedly up to.\nFollowing the discovery and description of the feather and first skeleton, over the years a number of other specimens came out of Solnhofen and one other locality and each gained a nickname, normally based on the museum they ended up in. After a long campaign to secure the specimen, the first skeleton ended up in the Natural History Museum London and became known as the London specimen. A second skeleton, the Berlin specimen, was discovered in 1876 and described in 1884. The Maxberg specimen, currently missing, was found in 1956. The Haarlem specimen was found in 1855 but not described until 1973. The Eichstätt specimen was found in 1951 and described in 1973. The mysterious Solnhofen specimen, original locality unknown, was described in 1988. The Munich specimen was discovered in 1992 and described in 1993. A further six specimens have been found since the late 1990s including a specimen held in a private collection and one specimen still awaiting scientific description. These twelve specimens are all that is known about Archaeopteryx, and plenty of questions remain unanswered. A number of different identifications have been suggested, the number of species of Archaeopteryx is debated and size ranges across the known specimens have been posited as different developmental stages. Whether Archaeopteryx was capable of true flight has also been the subject of much debate in the literature. Controversy around the origin, loss and rediscovery of some specimens means that interpreting the geographical, geological and temporal range of this species or group of species is also difficult. Twelve skeletons and a feather separated by thousands or tens of thousands of years in the geological record is an extremely limited data set to draw many firm conclusions from. Now, that list may be eleven skeletons and a feather thanks to the paper published this week: Re-evaluation of the Haarlem Archaeopteryx and the radiation of maniraptoran theropod dinosaurs (Foth & Rauhut 2017).\nThe ‘Haarlem specimen’, found in 1855 and described in 1975 is a part and a counter-part (two separate pieces of the same slab) which only preserves part of the right wing, part of the leg, some toes from both feet, a few vertebrae, belly ribs and fingers from the right hand. It is currently housed in the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands. The research team re-examined the Haarlem specimen and found that, even given the poor preservation, anatomical details were different enough to distinguish it from Archaeopteryx and warrant an entirely new genus. Proportions of the fossil bones present were distinct from Archaeopteryx. The presence of furrows on both sides of the phalanges (fingers) is a character shared with theropod dinosaurs Anchiornis and Eosinopteryx from China. This specimen is distinct from both of those in the small size of the claw. This specimen is geologically younger than the supposed relatives from China and these characteristics and temporal difference are given as the basis for the new species, Ostromia crassipes.\nAs a number of palaeontologists have expressed on social media – and the research team themselves comment in the paper – the grounds for these differences aren’t as robust as they could be due to the partial preservation of the Haarlem specimen, but this is all part and parcel of the self-correcting process of science. No doubt this new research will prompt other scientists to reevaluate this specimen, other Archaeopteryx specimens and other closely related groups and it’s probable that consensus won’t be reached for a while. Unfortunately for Ostromia crassipes, if the species holds up, it will likely always be associated with once being the iconic Archaeopteryx. As the researchers note, Archaeopteryx still holds onto one “perch” as the only Jurassic paravian theropod (the group of dinosaurs that also includes birds) outside of China, which isn’t quite as memorable as the first bird. On a more personal and unprofessional note, if you do find yourself in the Netherlands and in the mood for a museum, I’d skip the Van Goghs and the Monets and make a pilgrimage to see Ostromia crassipes and the other geological wonders of the Teylers Museum for yourself. General Reading There is quite a bit of literature about Archaeopteryx but two books stand out as an excellent overview of the history and discovery. Unfortunately, neither are up to date with recent discoveries. Bones of Contention: The Fossil that Shook Science by Paul Chambers is a popular science book that covers the controversy surrounding the discovery of Archaeopteryx, and the political and financial wrangling of scientists to get their hands on specimens. The second is Archaeopteryx: The Icon of Evolution by Peter Wellnhofer which is beautifully illustrated and packed with detail about the discovery, description and history of Archaeopteryx study.

This specimen is geologically younger than the supposed relatives from China and these characteristics and temporal difference are given as the basis for the new species, <em>Ostromia crassipes</em>.</p>"

No doubt this new research will prompt other scientists to reevaluate this specimen, other <em>Archaeopteryx </em>specimens and other closely related groups and it’s probable that consensus won’t be reached for a while. </p> \n<p>Unfortunately for <em>Ostromia crassipes</em>, if the species holds up, it will likely always be associated with once being the iconic <em>Archaeopteryx</em>. As the researchers note, <em>Archaeopteryx </em>still holds onto one “perch” as the only Jurassic paravian theropod (the group of dinosaurs that also includes birds) outside of China, which isn’t quite as memorable as the first bird. </p> \n<p>On a more personal and unprofessional note, if you do find yourself in the Netherlands and in the mood for a museum, I’d skip the Van Goghs and the Monets and make a pilgrimage to see <em>Ostromia crassipes </em>and the other geological wonders of the Teylers Museum for yourself. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>General Reading</strong></p> \n<p>There is quite a bit of literature about <em>Archaeopteryx </em>but two books stand out as an excellent overview of the history and discovery. Unfortunately, neither are up to date with recent discoveries. Bones of Contention: The Fossil that Shook Science by Paul Chambers is a popular science book that covers the controversy surrounding the discovery of <em>Archaeopteryx, </em>and the political and financial wrangling of scientists to get their hands on specimens. The second is <em>Archaeopteryx</em>: The Icon of Evolution by Peter Wellnhofer which is beautifully illustrated and packed with detail about the discovery, description and history of <em>Archaeopteryx </em>study. </p> \n<p><strong>References</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Foth, C. and Rauhut, O.

Land conservation is not simply about the economics, or the archaeological sites or the sage grouse or the cheap grazing for ranchers. Public lands conservation is about all those things bound up with the ribbon of intangibles. I am a passionate advocate of public lands for the impalpable experiences that these spaces provide – the ability to stretch our bodies on a trail, the compulsion to investigate the rocks and animals, the quiet stillness that is an escape from our modern world.

There are many economic reasons that public lands and open space are a public benefit.

Public lands conservation is about all those things bound up with the ribbon of intangibles.

                    "html": "<p>From a purely domestic point of view, the withdrawal from Unesco is also part of a pattern by the Trump administration to shrink our public lands and restrict our ability to study, protect, and preserve our heritage sites. A little more than ten days after withdrawing from Unesco, the administration proposed a steep fee hike for 17 of the most visited national parks in the American system, with some parks facing entrance fees of $70 (£52). Sure to decrease the number of visitors, this comes on top of a proposed budget decrease of $297m. This is also an undemocratic, classist maneuver to further marginalize poorer Americans and decrease their access to public lands that they deserve to enjoy. </p> \n<p>Which brings us back to the Unesco withdrawal. One of the most visible programs run by Unesco is the designation of World Heritage Sites – places that are recognized as significant to all humanity, which allow us to understand who we are, or possess natural values that are celebrated across the globe. The US has 23 Unesco World Heritage sites, 20 of which are operated by the National Park Service. Nearly all of our World Heritage Sites are operated by a federal agency that has had its budget and personnel cut, is facing more threats to its budget, and has a $12bn backlog of deferred maintenance, much of which is for historic sites and properties. </p> \n<p>Also in October, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jun/06/public-land-giveawayfive-congressional-leaders\">Utah Representative Rob Bishop</a> introduced the National Monument Creation and Protection Act (H.R. 3990), or what many opponents are calling the “no new parks” bill. This bill, which passed out of committee without a hearing, would not only make it more difficult for a president to designate a national monument, but would also make it easier to reduce or un-designate a national monument, as Secretary Zinke and President Trump propose to do at Bears Ears. This is an attack on the 1906 Antiquities Act, the first piece of legislation that was established to protect archaeological sites in the United States, and gave us monuments and parks such as the Grand Canyon and Devil’s Tower.</p>"

This is the same false foundation that Bishop’s no-new-parks bill is built on – the insinuation that politicians somewhere else are making intimately local decisions. This is a dangerous falsehood on which to base such sweeping alterations to our public lands conservation laws. Never mind the fact that the federal employees who are tasked with the protection of these national monuments are citizens of the states in which these monuments are located, and have dedicated their careers to serving the American people. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/04/president-trump-decimate-bears-ears-national-monument\">former Department of Interior Secretary Sally Jewell has recently stated</a>, the designation of Bears Ears was a long process with local input from important stakeholders, including local governments. Despite the description of the Antiquities Act as a method for a US president to unilaterally designate areas, the truth is that the process takes years, and hundreds of people, analyzing information and coming to compromises to set aside lands for the public benefit, in perpetuity. </p> \n<p>This baseless claim also dismisses the Native American tribes who are the stewards of Bears Ears as outsiders, a distinction that has long been used by Anglo-Americans as a tool to disenfranchise Native Americans, and minimize their relationship to the very lands they call home. That Native Americans see these monuments as homelands is not an abstraction. All or part of the tribal lands for the Hopi, Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute, and the Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation are within the political boundaries of the state of Utah. Other tribes, including the Zuni, reside in nearby states. These are people with a direct geographic and temporal link to these buttes and mesas, to say nothing of their spiritual connection. Like the Bureau of Land Management and US Forest Service employees, these tribal peoples are locals. </p>"

His first blister appeared when he was a week old, but soon after his family fled their native Syria and arrived as refugees in Germany, things got much worse. By June 2015, Hassan was admitted to hospital, critically ill, having lost the skin from almost the entire surface of his body. “Except for his face, hands and feet, he didn’t have any skin left,” his father recalls.</p> <p>Having run out of conventional treatments, his doctors were preparing to start palliative care.

Pig scaffolds do not pose a risk, but manufacturing them does not readily scale up to treating hundreds or thousands of patients.

Eventually they want to build new ears for children born without any – a bit like earmouse, except the real deal.</p> <p>The team have worked out how to coax stem cells found in fat into cartilage and can grow small pieces that look and feel like the natural version. But natural ear cartilage, it turns out, is too soft to build an ear from scratch; when placed under the skin, scar tissue forms around it, slowly crushing it. The next problem, then, is to create something tougher, more like the cartilage found around the ribs.</p> <p>The team are at the stage of experimenting with how to grow big enough pieces for an ear. One option is squirting the cells into a gel in the desired shape, using a 3D printer; or growing lots of small pellets of cartilage and pouring them into a mould to set, like jelly cubes.</p> <p>After this, they will carry out trials with large animals, probably attaching the ear on the side of a pig’s face, to check that it has the right mechanical properties. Ferretti hopes to begin a patient trial within five years. “We need to see how close to the real McCoy what we’re producing is,” says Ferretti. “I don’t think we’re super far.”</p> <p>Scientists classify stem cells according to a hierarchy of “stem-ness”. Embryonic stem cells are the ultimate master cells – they can divide indefinitely and, with the correct biochemical cues, turn into any cell type in the body. Adult stem cells, found in tissues such as skin and bone marrow, are already somewhat specialised, but can still divide, proliferate and mature. Scientists have also found ways to “rewind” adult cells into a state of greater plasticity, so-called induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells.</p> <p>Realising regenerative medicine’s most ambitious goals means working out which cells to start with and how to streamline the pathway towards specialisation. Prof Doug Melton, a stem cell scientist at Harvard University, has been working on this problem for two decades. His mission began when his son, Sam, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at six months old. He recalls the shock and feeling: “What’s happening to my world?

In its absence, the body’s sugar levels fluctuate wildly, meaning that patients need to monitor glucose and typically inject insulin several times each day. “Injecting insulin has been the treatment for nearly 100 years and the only real advances have been the way it’s provided, via a pen or a pump,” says Melton.</p> <p>Although insulin injections help to keep glucose levels broadly in check, the system is crude in comparison with the body’s fine tuning, and the lack of control can eventually lead to complications, from blindness to the loss of limbs, and shortens life by a decade, on average.</p> <p>“The starting point was: why don’t you just make the beta cell and put it back?” says Melton. “You’d replace the finger pricks and the injections with nature’s own invention.”</p> <p>Yet nature turned out to be hard to replicate and Melton worked for 15 years to get to the point where his lab could transform embryonic stem cells into pancreatic beta cells at large enough volumes to treat patients.</p> <p>“The challenge was how to get mastery over that process,” says Melton. “It’s not a one-step process; it’s a six-step, 30- to 40-day process.”</p> <p>The pancreas, a large gland in the stomach, contains hundreds of millions of beta cells – together they would occupy the volume of a pea.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Two years ago, Hassan’s father was faced with questions that he had no good answers for. “Why do I have this disease?” his seven-year-old son asked him. “Why do I have to live this life?” Hassan was born with a rare genetic skin condition, called epidermolysis bullosa, that causes fragile, blistering skin. His first blister appeared when he was a week old, but soon after his family fled their native Syria and arrived as refugees in Germany, things got much worse. By June 2015, Hassan was admitted to hospital, critically ill, having lost the skin from almost the entire surface of his body. “Except for his face, hands and feet, he didn’t have any skin left,” his father recalls. Having run out of conventional treatments, his doctors were preparing to start palliative care. But, as a last resort, they contacted an Italian scientist, Michele de Luca, who had carried out genetically modified skin transplants – but on nothing approaching this scale.\nIn a remarkable scientific breakthrough, De Luca’s team went on to grow an entire replacement skin for Hassan. It was grafted on, like a patchwork quilt, and after spending months bandaged from head to toe, Hassan emerged effectively cured of his devastating illness. Two years on, he is well, his skin no longer blisters, he needs no medication or ointments, he plays football and, when he gets a cut, he heals normally. “It felt like a dream for us,” the boy’s father says. De Luca says that witnessing the recovery produced “one of the strongest emotions in my whole life ... For a scientist working in this field, having these results justifies an entire career.” It also marked a rare and long-awaited clinical success for the field of regenerative medicine, which has faced criticism for delivering just a handful of therapies after years of hype.\nScientists first succeeded in culturing human embryonic stem cells in 1998.

It was grafted on, like a patchwork quilt, and after spending months bandaged from head to toe, Hassan emerged effectively cured of his devastating illness. Two years on, he is well, his skin no longer blisters, he needs no medication or ointments, he plays football and, when he gets a cut, he heals normally.</p> \n<p>“It felt like a dream for us,” the boy’s father says.</p> \n<p>De Luca says that witnessing the recovery produced “one of the strongest emotions in my whole life ... For a scientist working in this field, having these results justifies an entire career.”</p> \n<p>It also marked a rare and long-awaited clinical success for the field of regenerative medicine, which has faced criticism for delivering just a handful of therapies after years of hype.</p>"

The cells, extracted from donated IVF embryos, can divide and multiply indefinitely and morph into any other cell type in the body. The advance raised the prospect of limitless supplies of lab-grown cells – blood, liver, skin – and ultimately spare organs and body parts, grown from scratch in the laboratory. The image of the infamous “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacanti_mouse\">earmouse</a>”, published a year earlier, seemed to hint that scientists were already on the brink of such capabilities. In fact, the “ear” was cow cartilage and no human cells were involved, but the seed of expectation was sown.</p> \n<p>De Luca says that, from the start, there was an unrealistic sense of how quickly therapeutic uses would arrive, fuelling frenzied competition within the field, and people taking shortcuts or, worse, falsifying results.</p> \n<p>Most notorious among these was Paolo Macchiarini, an Italian surgeon, who was <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20671-man-receives-worlds-first-synthetic-windpipe/\">feted as a medical superstar</a> when he claimed in 2011 to have successfully transplanted the world’s first synthetic windpipe, a plastic scaffold seeded with a patient’s own stem cells. The remarkable story <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/sep/01/paolo-macchiarini-scientist-surgeon-rise-and-fall\">later unravelled</a> as it emerged that seven (now eight) of the nine patients to receive the synthetic tracheas had died and, last year, Macchiarini was fired from Sweden’s Karolinska Institute for misconduct.</p> \n<p>“The Macchiarini case was detrimental to the entire field, but we should not generalise,” says De Luca. “We don’t have to stop doing regenerative medicine, even in that specific field, because of what happened. We just have to do things properly.”</p>"

Before I visit his lab, three separate people tell me De Coppi is “very charismatic”, then add “but sensible”, or a similar disclaimer. Post-Macchiarini, too much showmanship can raise red flags.</p> \n<p>De Coppi takes me on a swift tour of the research department he leads at University College London. At one point, as we zoom down a corridor, he opens what looks like a broom cupboard, revealing instead a small walk-in fridge lined with shelves loaded with tiny organs. “This is a decellurised rat liver,” he says, picking up a jar with what looks like a small, translucent ball of mozzarella floating within. “This one’s an intestine.” Bladder, kidney, cartilage and lung tissue are being grown elsewhere in the building, he says.</p> \n<p>He describes the protocol for creating a new oesophagus. The decellurised scaffold is basted in patient stem cells, called mesoangioblasts, that are found around blood vessels. “Normally, when there is an injury these cells can migrate and proliferate to regenerate new muscle fibres,” De Coppi says.</p> \n<p>When placed in a bioreactor – a jar that has nutrients pumped in one end and waste products sucked out the other – these cells begin to form a tube of smooth muscle. This is then placed under the skin of the stomach and blood vessels automatically begin to vascularise it.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, outside the body, a second set of stem cells taken from the gullet will be cultured into thin sheets that are wrapped around a dissolvable polymer scaffold to make the organ’s epithelium lining. This is where De Luca’s expertise will come in, as growing epithelium efficiently relies on similar techniques to those he refined for cultivating external skin.</p> \n<p>Finally, the vascularised muscle tube will be taken out from the stomach, the lining slotted inside and the transplant stitched into the patient – although no one has been treated yet.</p> \n<p>The team have had “promising” results in a study in rabbits, expected to be published in the next few months, and intend to move to pigs before beginning in human patients in 2019 if all goes to plan. The human trial will involve babies with a condition called oesophageal atresia, in which part of the oesophagus is missing from birth.</p> \n<p>Treating the first patient, even one with few alternatives, still requires a leap of faith, De Coppi says. “You wouldn’t be a good doctor if you didn’t feel some fear in these situations. The only time you can’t have fear is in theatre; at that point, the decision has been made and you have to think this is the best thing. Before that you have a lot of doubt.”</p>"

                    "html": "<p>The ultimate goal remains to make synthetic organs from scratch using a synthetic scaffold, as Macchiarini tried and failed to do with tracheas. Pig scaffolds do not pose a risk, but manufacturing them does not readily scale up to treating hundreds or thousands of patients. However, De Coppi says that matching the quality of a natural scaffold is probably still 20 years away. “Despite [attempts at] synthetic organs, we are still far away from mimicking what mother nature has done,” he says.</p> \n<p>His colleague Prof Patrizia Ferretti is leading a team working on lab-grown cartilage. Eventually they want to build new ears for children born without any – a bit like earmouse, except the real deal.</p> \n<p>The team have worked out how to coax stem cells found in fat into cartilage and can grow small pieces that look and feel like the natural version. But natural ear cartilage, it turns out, is too soft to build an ear from scratch; when placed under the skin, scar tissue forms around it, slowly crushing it. The next problem, then, is to create something tougher, more like the cartilage found around the ribs.</p> \n<p>The team are at the stage of experimenting with how to grow big enough pieces for an ear. One option is squirting the cells into a gel in the desired shape, using a 3D printer; or growing lots of small pellets of cartilage and pouring them into a mould to set, like jelly cubes.</p> \n<p>After this, they will carry out trials with large animals, probably attaching the ear on the side of a pig’s face, to check that it has the right mechanical properties. Ferretti hopes to begin a patient trial within five years. “We need to see how close to the real McCoy what we’re producing is,” says Ferretti. “I don’t think we’re super far.”</p> \n<p>Scientists classify stem cells according to a hierarchy of “stem-ness”. Embryonic stem cells are the ultimate master cells – they can divide indefinitely and, with the correct biochemical cues, turn into any cell type in the body. Adult stem cells, found in tissues such as skin and bone marrow, are already somewhat specialised, but can still divide, proliferate and mature. Scientists have also found ways to “rewind” adult cells into a state of greater plasticity, so-called induced pluripotent stem (IPS) cells.</p> \n<p>Realising regenerative medicine’s most ambitious goals means working out which cells to start with and how to streamline the pathway towards specialisation. Prof Doug Melton, a stem cell scientist at Harvard University, has been working on this problem for two decades. His mission began when his son, Sam, was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at six months old. He recalls the shock and feeling: “What’s happening to my world? This isn’t something we’ve planned for.” His daughter, Emma, later received the same diagnosis, by which time Melton had abandoned his research on frog eggs and embarked on his quest for a cure.</p>"

                    "html": "<p>In diabetes, the immune system kills off all the body’s pancreatic beta cells, leaving it unable to produce insulin. In its absence, the body’s sugar levels fluctuate wildly, meaning that patients need to monitor glucose and typically inject insulin several times each day. “Injecting insulin has been the treatment for nearly 100 years and the only real advances have been the way it’s provided, via a pen or a pump,” says Melton.</p> \n<p>Although insulin injections help to keep glucose levels broadly in check, the system is crude in comparison with the body’s fine tuning, and the lack of control can eventually lead to complications, from blindness to the loss of limbs, and shortens life by a decade, on average.</p> \n<p>“The starting point was: why don’t you just make the beta cell and put it back?” says Melton. “You’d replace the finger pricks and the injections with nature’s own invention.”</p> \n<p>Yet nature turned out to be hard to replicate and Melton worked for 15 years to get to the point where his lab could transform embryonic stem cells into pancreatic beta cells at large enough volumes to treat patients.</p> \n<p>“The challenge was how to get mastery over that process,” says Melton. “It’s not a one-step process; it’s a six-step, 30- to 40-day process.”</p> \n<p>The pancreas, a large gland in the stomach, contains hundreds of millions of beta cells – together they would occupy the volume of a pea. Melton’s lab can grow around a million cells per millilitre – enough cells to replace those lost in diabetes can be grown in a teapot-sized vessel.</p> \n<p>In mice, Melton’s lab-grown cells have been shown to work normally for many months, automatically detecting glucose and secreting insulin as required. Before transplanting, the cells are placed inside a porous capsule, which allows insulin to diffuse out, but protects the cells from attacks by the body’s immune system. This also eliminates the need for genetic-matching to patients, which Melton hopes will allow the cells, one day, to be produced on an industrial scale.</p> \n<p>“I think of beer commercials with people standing next to giant stainless steel vats,” says Melton. “That is what will happen, but it’s not going to happen in the next few years.”</p> \n<p>Through his startup company, Semma (named after his children Sam and Emma) Therapeutics, Melton is carrying out the final phase of animal trials and hoping to begin his first clinical trial by 2020. Patients will have a thin capsule of cells, about the size of a credit card, placed beneath the skin (the arm or inner thigh, perhaps). The first steps will be establishing safety and how long the cells are active for – the hope is a year or more, but they could last for more than a decade; mice don’t live long enough to test this. At his family’s recent Thanksgiving dinner, Melton asked his children, now in their 20s, whether they would like to be involved in the first trial.</p> \n<p>“It’s the first time they heard about the dates when the trial might be happening,” he says. “They’re both thinking about it.”</p> \n<p>Melton jokes that his children probably wonder: “What the hell is taking so long, Dad?”</p> \n<p>In a field that has such incredible potential, delays are hard to live with. Every year of waiting means that babies with fatal congenital defects can’t be treated, diabetics continue to die early, damaged hearts can’t be healed.</p> \n<p>Scientists who have been working for decades to harness the curative powers of stem cells have not forgotten these grand goals. Many are now within touching distance of delivering transformative therapies. Cell therapy trials for age-related macular degeneration (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9ab098-654c-11e6-8310-ecf0bddad227\">one at Moorfields Eye hospital</a>) and other forms of blindness are delivering promising results; this year, scientists came significantly closer to building a pipeline to manufacture vast quantities of <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/lab-grown-blood-stem-cells-produced-at-last/\">lab-grown blood</a>; a study in monkeys suggested that implanting neurons derived from stem cells could help <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/news/reprogrammed-cells-relieve-parkinson-s-symptoms-in-trials-1.22531\">treat Parkinson’s</a>.</p> \n<p>“I do realise that talking to reporters, when I say ‘years away’, they think ‘our readers don’t care about this’,” Melton says. “But when you’re successful, that lasts for 100 years.”</p>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "In my puzzle blog earlier today I set you the following puzzle: Five cars are driving round a roundabout. In order, the drivers are Akira, Basho, Chie, Daichi and Etsu. The cars have licence plates numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, but not necessarily in that order. Each driver can see only the licence plate of the car in front of them and the car behind them, but not of the car they are driving. All the drivers can speak to and hear each other via headphones. A voice comes into their headphones and asks: “Is your licence plate a square number?” They all reply in unison: “I don’t know” The voice repeats: “Is your licence plate a square number?” They reply in unison “I don’t know!” except Etsu, who pipes up saying: “Erm, no”. The voice asks: “Is your licence plate number bigger than the number of the plate behind you?” Daichi is getting annoyed now: “I don’t know!”. After which Basho and Etsu state: “No” And Akira and Chie grin: “Yes” Who is in which car? Solution. Scroll down for the answer. Or if you would like to solve it yourself, use each step as a hint before moving on to the next one. Step 1. The cars are numbered from 1 to 5. The only two square numbers in this group are 1 and 4. (Which are 12 and 22). When asked if their car is a square number, i.e. either 1 or 4, all drivers say ‘I don’t know’.

If the two cars a driver sees are the 1 and the 4, then that driver would respond ‘no’, since they know their car is neither the 1 nor the 4. Since no one says ‘no’, we can dismiss the situation in which there is a single car in between the 1 and the 4. In a circle of five cars, if there is no single car between the 1 and the 4, then the 1 and the 4 must be adjacent. Step 2 The same question is asked again, ‘is your car a 1 or a 4’, and Etsu says no. We can deduce that Etsu is in the position opposite the 1 and the 4. She will have worked out from Step 1 that the 1 and the 4 are adjacent. If she could see either a 1 or a 4, her response would be ‘I don’t know’, so she must see neither the 1 nor the 4.

Because we know the order of the drivers, we know that the 1 and 4 have Basho in one and Chie in the other, and the 2, 3 and 5 are divided among Akira, Daichi and Etsu. Step 3 The voice asks if the driver’s plate is bigger than the one behind. Daichi doesn’t know. He knows from Steps 1 and 2 that the 1 is taken by either Basho or Chie, which means that we can deduce he is not seeing the 2 behind him, since if he was he would know that his is larger and have answered ‘yes’. And we can also deduce he is not seeing the 5, since then he would have answered ‘no’. So Daichi is seeing a 3. (i.e. Etsu is 3) Basho sees Chie behind him. He answers that his number is NOT bigger than Chie’s, in which case it must be less, which means that he is seeing a 4 behind him. So we know Chie’s car is 4 and Basho’s is 1.
