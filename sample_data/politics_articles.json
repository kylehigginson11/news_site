Prominently displayed on an easel, a sign read “ATENDIMENTO: Publico. Individual.

Here is chief reporter Ana Aranha: Repórter Brasil has joined the effort to unearth São Paulo’s hidden stories with the Guardian Cities team, who are using our office as headquarters. Since 2001, our nonprofit has been investigating international supply chains that connect the world consumer market with Brazil’s deep-rooted problems, such as slave labour and the indiscriminate use of pesticides. In fact, this morning Repórter Brasil is releasing a story on pesticides that are banned in the EU, but largely allowed in our country – the world’s largest herbicide consumer. Later this week with Guardian Cities we will also publish an expose of the illegal “Night Market” run by slave labour, and a report on how the city’s indigenous community fought back by seizing a TV tower. And we kick off today with our own Leonardo Sakamoto’s impassioned view on how inequality divides the landscape of the city:",

There are restrictions, including if you cannot prove your knowledge of English or your spouse does not meet the minimum income requirement of £18,000 or cash savings above £16,000, but that is unlikely to be an issue for the couple. </p> \n<p>It is not clear which visa Meghan is currently using to be in the UK, but if she is here on a visitor visa, under the official system, she would need to leave the UK in order to apply for her family visa. </p>"

However, the future princess has been critical of the US president, branding him “misogynistic”.</p> <p>The prospect of Trump attending the ceremony is an unlikely one. With the level of protection that surrounds an American president, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event.</p> <p>Trump’s appearance could also spark mass protests.</p> <p>When Theresa May offered Trump an early invite for a state visit, the decision proved controversial with polls suggesting up to two million people would take to the streets to demonstrate should the trip go ahead.</p> <p>In 2011, the then US president, Barack Obama, and the first lady, Michelle Obama, were not invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, reportedly because of the added security cost. But they were feted with a state visit to the UK a month later.</p> <p>Should Trump travel to the UK for a state visit, it would be expected that the newly royal Markle would meet him and join guests at the state banquet. But Markle, who backed Hillary Clinton for president, suggested in a television interview in 2016 that she would leave the US for Canada if Trump won.</p> <p>She said: “We film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada. I mean come on, if that’s reality we are talking about, come on, that is a gamechanger in terms of how we move in the world here.”</p> <p>Markle told Larry Wilmore’s Nightly Show in the US: “Yes, of course Trump is divisive.</p> <p>“Think about just female voters alone.

              "bodyTextSummary": "He has yet to tweet today, and the prolific social media ranter Donald Trump faces a dilemma. The diplomatic course of action, as the leader of Britain’s closest ally, would be to congratulate Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. However, the future princess has been critical of the US president, branding him “misogynistic”. The prospect of Trump attending the ceremony is an unlikely one. With the level of protection that surrounds an American president, the inclusion of Trump would give security chiefs a headache as they work to police the high-profile event. Trump’s appearance could also spark mass protests. When Theresa May offered Trump an early invite for a state visit, the decision proved controversial with polls suggesting up to two million people would take to the streets to demonstrate should the trip go ahead. In 2011, the then US president, Barack Obama, and the first lady, Michelle Obama, were not invited to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, reportedly because of the added security cost. But they were feted with a state visit to the UK a month later. Should Trump travel to the UK for a state visit, it would be expected that the newly royal Markle would meet him and join guests at the state banquet. But Markle, who backed Hillary Clinton for president, suggested in a television interview in 2016 that she would leave the US for Canada if Trump won. She said: “We film Suits in Toronto and I might just stay in Canada. I mean come on, if that’s reality we are talking about, come on, that is a gamechanger in terms of how we move in the world here.” Markle told Larry Wilmore’s Nightly Show in the US: “Yes, of course Trump is divisive. “Think about just female voters alone. I think it was in 2012, the Republican party lost the female vote by 12 points. That’s a huge number and as misogynistic as Trump is and so vocal about it, that’s a huge chunk of it.” For the 1981 wedding of Harry’s parents, the Prince of Wales and Lady Diana Spencer, Ronald Reagan did not attend but his wife, Nancy Reagan, did. This could be an option for Harry, who has already met the current first lady, Melania Trump. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, will be expected to receive one of the sought-after invites, along with other Commonwealth leaders from across the globe.",

Asked about Prince Harry’s engagement, he said: “I don’t know much about him.”</p> \n<p>The one Briton the Guardian was able to find was a tour guide who had been showing Essel and others from his party the sights. “Personally I couldn’t care less, but for my job I have to take an interest,” she said. </p> \n<p>“I hope it will never be on the front page when there are so many other important things happening. I bet Theresa [May] will be pleased; we’ve got a royal wedding as a distraction.”</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, she said she had nothing against Harry, and it was a good thing that his marrying a mixed race woman would introduce a bit of diversity into the royal family. But, she added: “He’s the spare anyway, he’s not important. He’s not even the spare now, he’s way down the line.”</p>"

In her own words, she said she was “an actress, a writer, the editor-in-chief of my lifestyle brand The Tig, a pretty good cook, and a firm believer in handwritten notes”. In what was seen as a sign of Markle getting ready to marry into the royals, she brought an abrupt end to her blog in April 2017. She removed all posts and closed the site, posting a message that began: “After close to three beautiful years on this adventure with you, it’s time to say goodbye to The Tig.” But she gave no explanation as to why she had made her decision. In September 2017, her engagement to Harry looked set when she appeared on the cover of the US magazine Vanity Fair and talked about her relationship. “We’re two people who are really happy and in love,” she said. She was born on 4 August 1981 to her clinical therapist mother, Doria Radlan, and her TV lighting director father, Thomas Markle. She grew up in Los Angeles, and studied at a girls’ Roman Catholic college. Her parents divorced when she was six. Markle has written about her mixed heritage – her father is caucasian and of Dutch and Irish descent and her mother is African American – and how it created “a grey area surrounding my self-identification”. Markle graduated from Northwestern University in theatre and international relations.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "The 255-page industrial strategy white paper is out. You can read it here (pdf). As the Press Association reports, business groups welcomed the government’s industrial strategy, but unions and opposition parties have attacked it - with one official branding it a “joke.” The TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: Ministers have failed to explain how workers will be given a say in the new industrial strategy. They are missing a trick if they don’t listen to the factory floor. The GMB leader Tim Roache said: To suggest what we need are ‘new business models’ in care as part of an industrial strategy is an unfunny joke from a government that just doesn’t get it. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: Business leaders will welcome the Government’s grand ambition to turn around the UK’s woeful performance productivity. The measures in today’s industrial strategy could be the beginning of a bold, new approach to the economy - but only if what has been announced today is followed through, not just in this parliament, but over many parliaments to come. Rebecca Long-Bailey, shadow business secretary, said: This is a white paper made up of re-announced policies and old spending commitments, showing once again that this is a government short on details and new ideas. Nothing in the white paper will help give businesses the certainty or incentives they need to invest in the face of the government’s catastrophic handling of Brexit. What detail there is concentrates on a few elite industries in which Britain already has an advantage, and will do nothing to help the millions of people who work in low productivity and low wage sectors such as retail, hospitality and social care. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: The combination of falling apprenticeship starts and restricted access to skilled labour after Brexit will cripple the industrial strategy. What is being announced today is not much more than a reinvention of the wheel. We’ve had an industrial strategy already for five years. But there is a big cloud hanging over it now caused by the major uncertainties around Brexit. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, said: Nine in 10 firms see a modern Industrial Strategy as vital to improving living standards in the face of Brexit uncertainty and a sombre economic outlook. This announcement shows the government has its eye firmly on the horizon, not just the next few yards. We welcome the recognition that success will require urgent action in partnership with business.

              "bodyTextSummary": "Richard Leonard, the new Scottish Labour leader, is to greatly overhaul his party’s policies and closely align its strategies with Jeremy Corbyn’s approach at Westminster, in a clear break from the stance taken by his predecessor Kezia Dugdale. After winning a convincing victory in the Scottish leadership contest, Leonard has announced he plans to set up 12 policy reviews covering areas such as council funding, housing, children’s health, climate change and renewables, as well as a commission on tax reform. His credentials as Corbyn’s preferred candidate were underlined after Corbyn pledged he “would as closely as possible” with Leonard, who was backed heavily by the unions, at a joint appearance in Glasgow on Monday morning. In an implicit criticism of Scottish Labour’s previously centrist positioning and its distaste for fully-fledged Corbynism under Dugdale, Corbyn stressed the case for unity between the UK and Scottish parties. “Now our whole party and movement must campaign together to inspire people in every nation and region of the UK to have the confidence to be a country that genuinely cares for all,” Corbyn said in an advance text. Leonard offered some overtures to his party’s centrists by name-checking John Smith, the former UK party leader and moderate whose sudden death in 1994 led to Tony Blair’s election as leader, and paying tribute to his centrist rival for the post, Anas Sarwar. Lauding Corbyn’s “principles, policies and integrity”, Leonard said: Together, we can seize the day and, as John Smith said when he became Labour leader, ‘persuade millions of the strength of our vision, the relevance of our policies and the urgency of our demand for change’. Labour has changed, and now we are determined to change Scotland. That is our task today; it is one I am confident that we can achieve together.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "Talks on forming another “grand coalition” government in Germany are unlikely to fully start until next year as the Social Democratic party (SPD) continues to weigh up the risks of working again with Angela Merkel. Merkel’s chances of a fourth term as chancellor were thrown into doubt this month when talks about a three-way “Jamaica coalition” between her Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the Free Democrats and the Greens collapsed. At the end of last week the SPD leader, Martin Schulz, budged from his previous position and indicated he was open to exploring the possibility of a re-run of the centrist coalition between Germany’s two largest parties that has governed the country for the last four years. But he continues to face pressure from MPs and party members who worry that another grand coalition could drive the SPD into an existential crisis. On Monday Schulz said he was prepared to walk out of talks if other parties did not show enough flexibility. He said the SPD would rely “on the strength of its arguments, not showmanship in the media.” Merkel reiterated her scepticism about the possibility of a minority government, stating that “the formation of a stable government is a value in itself”. Schulz and Merkel will visit the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, for a first exploratory meeting on Thursday. Julia Klöckner, a CDU vice-chair, said coalition talks were unlikely to begin until the new year, more than three months after the federal elections in which there were significant losses for the CDU and SPD and gains for smaller parties. Delegates on the left wing of the SPD are encouraging Schulz to offer Merkel his support for a minority government instead of being drawn into a formal coalition agreement. “The SPD should only open itself up to another coalition with Merkel if it wants to commit suicide,” said Marco Bülow, a Dortmund MP. “We’ve tried it twice, and each time we ended up with our face in the mud. A third time and we’d be like lemmings.” Bülow suggested his party could instead lend a CDU-Green minority government support on passing a budget, and in return demand infrastructure investments, higher pensions and a U-turn on the outgoing finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble’s fixation on balancing the books. SPD leftwingers spot a parallel between the current political situation and the twilight years of Helmut Kohl’s chancellorship. Under Oskar Lafontaine’s leadership in the late 90s, the SPD was able to raise its profile and influence government decision-making in opposition by blocking CDU-led tax reforms. But while a grand coalition remains unpopular with the SPD base and has its delegates split down the middle, support is likely to increase once coalition talks gain momentum. Advocates of another coalition between the country’s biggest parties argue that only a stable German government would be able to meet expectations of leadership and reform from elsewhere in the European Union. For the last two months German politics has been unable to react to the French president Emmanuel Macron’s vision for “profound” changes in a post-Brexit EU, laid out days after Germany’s federal election in September. Macron’s proposals included shoring up the 19-member eurozone with a finance minister, budget and parliament – ideas dependent on the backing of Berlin. Schulz indicated on Monday that if there was an argument that could convince his party to form part of Germany’s next government, it was the future of the EU. He said the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, had encouraged him to open himself up to coalition talks. By that same logic, the prize Schulz might try to extract from Merkel in exchange for his party engaging in government-building could end up being the influential and much-coveted post in the German finance ministry.",

We may also have conquered the national hang-up about government intervening to support business. And, on paper, there is now official acknowledgment that the geographically lop-sized state of the UK economy, and our historical underinvestment in infrastructure, are major sources of our woeful productivity performance.</p> \n<p>In other words, there is much to like the white paper, even if the actual sums of new money to be put behind the new approach remain anybody’s guess. As with January’s green paper, too many existing polices were shoehorned into the document and presented as if they were fresh.</p> \n<p>Still, the future priority is consistent policy-making. On that score, there are reasons to be optimistic. The Institute for Government pointed out in its All Change report earlier this year that the UK has had three industrial strategies in the past 15 years. The churn in policy-making has been caused, in large part, by disagreements about the relationship between industry and government.</p> \n<p>Sajid Javid, Greg Clark’s immediate predecessor, tended to be sniffy about industrial strategies (or, at least, anything that smelled like picking winners) and mostly saw government’s role as being one of deregulating and clearing obstacles to growth. Clark and Theresa May’s approach may mark the definitive moment when the UK decides to be interventionist. If so, that is very welcome.</p> \n<p>The new “sector deals” – in effect, collaborations between government and the private sector – really only acknowledge that other countries have taken a similar line for years. In fact, when its back is against the wall, so has the UK: without inducements for foreign investors, the car sector could have died with British Leyland. And, in a sector such as life sciences, where one of the new deals has already been struck, it would be ridiculous to ignore ties between public and private sectors. The UK has done well in pharmaceuticals partly because of the existence of the NHS and top-class universities. </p> \n<p>Will the new approach last, though? Alarmingly, the single biggest innovation in the 255-page document received only a half a dozen sentences. It was the creation of a new independent body to measure progress in the grand effort to retool the UK economy.</p> \n<p>Such a body will exist – it will be called the Industrial Strategy Council – but Clark offered few details beyond the fact that would be be “drawn from leading business men and women, investors, economists and academics from across the UK” and would have access to government data.</p> \n<p>That tells us next to nothing about the new council’s standing in Westminster and Whitehall. The CBI had lobbied for an organisation with the status of the Office for Budget Responsibility and the government, it seemed, had encouraged the idea that was on cards. If so, it’s not the white paper in solid form.</p> \n<p>Dr Craig Berry, from the Sheffield Political Economy Research Institute and a member of the independent Industrial Strategy Commission, is right to worry that “the proposed advisory council falls short of the OBR-style monitoring body required to embed industrial strategy into the routine agendas of future governments”.

Robespierre does have his own metro station – but for how long?</p> \n<p>Two years ago, the feminist group <a href=\"https://www.citylab.com/design/2015/08/the-streets-of-paris-renamed-for-women/402526/\">Osez le féminisme</a> pointed out only 2% of French streets (2.6% in Paris) and 3% of Paris metro stations had female names. They suggested there should be a Pont Josephine Baker and Quai Nina Simone. Afterwards, La Ville-aux-Dames near Tours named <a href=\"https://www.ouest-france.fr/leditiondusoir/data/687/reader/reader.html?t=1456161084919#!preferred/1/package/687/pub/688/page/7\">all its streets after women</a>.</p> \n<p>The naming of Rue Jo Cox can also be seen as a mark of French dismay over Brexit and the country’s enduring fondness for us “Anglo-Saxons”. It’s hard to imagine though, that the UK would name a street after Jean de Broglie, one of General de Gaulle’s ministers, shot dead in the street in 1976, or former government minister Joseph Fontanet, also gunned down in Paris in 1980.</p>"

Vagina-decorated nails are part of a bid to normalise conversations about abortion; in the week leading up to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/30/thousands-march-in-dublin-calling-for-end-to-irelands-abortion-ban\" title=\"\">Dublin’s March for Choice in September</a>, the salon was packed with women requesting manicures to match the message of the march. The salon is also one way to engage those not interested in current affairs. In the run-up to Ireland’s general election last February, Horan asked staff how they were voting. “A lot of them were just, like, ‘I don’t know – whatever my mam and dad are voting,’ or, ‘I don’t really vote,’” she says. “I suddenly snapped and thought: ‘There is this big army of women who work in beauty and if they were mobilised, there would be a lot more women’s voices calling for women’s issues to be prioritised.”</p> \n<p>Tropical Popical isn’t alone in mixing politics with nail polish. In the UK, activist Charlie Craggs educates people about her experience of life as a transgender woman through a pop-up salon, <a href=\"http://www.nailtransphobia.com/\" title=\"\">Nail Transphobia</a>, while nail-art sensations <a href=\"http://wah-london.com/\" title=\"\">WAH Nails</a>, in east London, have set up workshops to help young businesswomen in the trade. In the US, New York-based manicurist <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amivnails/?hl=en\" title=\"\">Ami Vega</a> creates “socially conscious” nails, highlighting ideas around Black Lives Matter and domestic violence. Charity-run salons providing training for disadvantaged women are also becoming popular. In London, <a href=\"http://www.artagainstknives.com/\" title=\"\">Art Against Knives</a> runs two-weekly community nail bars, both staffed by young women living on estates in Barnet. They offer business skills, mentoring and help with CVs – along with housing domestic violence services. <a href=\"http://www.theshinenailbar.org.uk/\" title=\"\">The Shine Nail Bar</a> in Leeds also provides volunteering and employment opportunities.</p>"

                    "html": "<p>Nail bars have also shed their reputation for being a luxury only the very wealthy could afford. Indeed, they thrived in the last economic downturn, providing an update on the adage that lipstick sales go up when recessions set in. Then there’s the closeness they foster: “You’re holding someone’s hand for an hour so it gives you the opportunity to build up intimacy really fast,” says Horan. The visual impact of nail art is also important – it can embolden the wearer, spark debate and engender a sense of community. But does this hold true when it comes to the nail industry’s unethical reputation? You don’t need to do more than skim the headlines intermittently to associate the sector, in Britain and the US at least, with stories about exploitation and human trafficking – mainly of women. In September, a report by the UK’s independent anti-slavery commissioner, Kevin Hyland, voiced concern about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/11/slavery-report-sounds-alarm-over-vietnamese-nail-bar-workers\" title=\"\">the trafficking of enslaved people from Vietnam to work in the nail bar industry</a>, calling for tighter regulation. There is no data on the number of salons run in this way, but, according to Mark Breadon from the Association of Nail Technicians, the body is collaborating with the Home Office to introduce licensing to eliminate corruption of this kind. However, progress is slow due to lack of consensus between councils, as well as feeble support from Westminster. “Unfortunately, no politician is willing to take it on board because it’s not a big vote winner,” he says.</p> \n<p>Given that disheartening reality, the notion of nail bars being a hotbed of women’s activism may seem unconvincing. Yet, returning to Andrea Horan at Tropical Popical, that perspective “tars a whole industry … with one very general brush”. Perhaps a fair way of putting it, then, is that, while the sector needs a clean-up, there are plenty of reputable nail bars – and as a concept they are well-placed, perhaps uniquely so, to have a positive impact on women’s lives.</p>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "Richard Leonard, the new Scottish Labour leader, has signalled in his first major speech on policy that he wants to see higher taxes on wealthy property owners to fund public services.\nWith the UK party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, by his side, Leonard said he believed the wealthy should pay higher taxes on their land and buildings, as well as face a one-off wealth tax for the richest 1%. He announced the formation of a party commission to review wholesale reform of Scotland’s income and property taxation system, from council tax through to inherited wealth, which is due to report by March 2018. “The richest 1% in Scotland today already own more personal wealth than the poorest 50% put together,” he told a party event in Glasgow. “This is unjust. This needs to change.” A former GMB political officer, Leonard won the Scottish Labour leadership contest comfortably against his centrist rival Anas Sarwar after being backed heavily by pro-Corbyn union leaders and Corbyn’s allies. While the tensions between Labour’s leftwingers and its centrists are far less pronounced at Holyrood than at Westminster, the leadership campaign quickly became caught up in the contest for overall control of Labour at UK level. In an implicit criticism of Scottish Labour’s previously centrist positioning under Kezia Dugdale, whose sudden resignation in August led to the Scottish leadership vacancy, Corbyn stressed the case for unity between the UK and Scottish parties. “Now our whole party and movement must campaign together to inspire people in every nation and region of the UK to have the confidence to be a country that genuinely cares for all,” he said. Leonard’s victory was “a turning point for our party in Scotland,” Corbyn added. In a further sign that he plans to sweeping and potentially radical changes to Scottish Labour’s policy platform, Leonard said there would be 12 policy reviews ranging from climate change policy to social care and the NHS, re-nationalising water and rail, to housing and child poverty. There are few specific details so far on Leonard’s tax plans. Sarwar wrong-footed him in the final stages of the leadership campaign by calling for a new 50p top tax band on those earning over £100,000, Leonard responded by suggesting a windfall tax on the wealthy and two new tax bands. The Scottish government said at the time Leonard’s plan to raise about £3.7bn from a one-off windfall tax of 1% on the wealthiest 10% in Scotland would need consent from Westminster. Leonard’s immediate challenge is to respond to a request from Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, that opposition parties at Holyrood suggest changes to Scotland’s income tax before her government’s draft budget is published on 14 December. He is expected to stick to Scottish Labour’s existing strategy, to reintroduce the 50p top rate for those earning over £150,000 along with a 1p rise in all other bands. The Scottish government’s own data showed that this would raise more than any other proposals. However, Leonard’s speech, where he again accused Sturgeon of managing austerity rather than fighting it, suggests it would only be an interim measure. His proposals involve significantly higher spending than Scottish Labour has suggested previously. Using the phrase “real change” 15 times in his speech, he confirmed he wanted to see far greater central planning from the government around economic investment, energy strategy and climate change. With Dugdale in Australia competing in the ITV reality show I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!, Leonard launched an implicit attack on the Dugdale era by concluding: “Scottish Labour has a new unity of purpose. Scottish Labour has changed, and now we are determined to change Scotland.”",
