Many hedge funds have also decided to include it in their portfolios and, according to CNBC, the financial news service, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/27/there-are-now-more-than-120-hedge-funds-focused-solely-on-bitcoin.html\">there are more than 120 funds investment devoted to cryptocurrencies</a>. </p> \n<p>Sayed said it was almost impossible to give the cryptocurrency a fair value based on fundamentals, but added that there had been a strong correlation between the price of bitcoin and number of users opening new wallets.</p> \n<p>He added: “Given that number of users haven’t exceeded 0.1% of the global population, there’s still more potential for this momentum trade to continue. Whether the price will be justified in the foreseeable future, depends on the adoption and the application of the new currency, but so far it still looks unstoppable.”</p> \n<p>The starkest warning has come from the JP Morgan chief executive, Jamie Dimon, who said bitcoin was a fraud that would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/13/bitcoin-fraud-jp-morgan-cryptocurrency-drug-dealers\">ultimately blow up</a>. </p> \n<p>There has been a boom in initial coin offerings (ICOs), in which new cryptocurrencies are launched into the market – often backed by a celebrity, such as the American socialite<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/paris-hilton-deletes-support-of-controversial-ico-2488431883.html\"> Paris Hilton</a> and the boxing champion <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/paris-hilton-backs-ico-lydian-celebrities-endorsing-cryptocurrencies-2017-9\">Floyd Mayweather</a>.</p> \n<p>ICOs have come under increased scrutiny from regulators, owing to fears that investors are not properly protected. David Futter<strong>, </strong>a<strong> </strong>partner in the digital economy at the law firm Ashurst,<strong> </strong>predicts that scrutiny will intensify.</p> \n<p>“Regulators know the rewards of cryptocurrency and blockchain could be huge, but have more than one eye on the catastrophic ramifications if good governance, stability and control are not preserved. </p> \n<p>“If the carrot of self-regulation proves insufficient, the regulators will not hesitate to use their stick.”<br /></p> \n<p>Follow Guardian Business on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BusinessDesk\">@BusinessDesk</a>, or sign up to the daily Business Today email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/2017/may/16/guardian-business-today-sign-up-financial-news-email?CMP=business_footnote\">here</a> •</p>"

                    "html": "<p>The government is planning to create a raft of new police powers as part of a crackdown on the civilian use of drones, the Department for Transport has announced.</p> \n<p>The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-powers-for-police-to-address-illegal-and-unsafe-use-of-drones\">new drone bill</a> to be published in 2018 will allow police officers to order drone operators to ground their devices where necessary, alongside a series of new changes that will create a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jul/22/drones-will-have-to-be-registered-in-uk-safety-clampdown\">mandatory registry</a> for larger unmanned aerial vehicles, such as those sold by Parrot or DJI.</p> \n<p>It could also include a ban on drones flying near airports or above 122 metres (400 feet), the government says, and a requirement for drone owners to use apps, rather than simple remote controls, to fly their aircraft, in order to ensure that the rules are always readily accessible and incorporated into the flight plan.</p> \n<p>The proposed bill will be accompanied by changes to the air navigation order that will introduce safety awareness tests for drone users, and the requirement to register with the government before flying drones that weigh more than 250g.</p> \n<p>Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg said: “Drones have great potential and we want to do everything possible to harness the benefits of this technology as it develops, but if we are to realise the full potential of this incredibly exciting technology, we have to take steps to stop illegal use of these devices and address safety and privacy concerns.</p> \n<p>“These new laws strike a balance, to allow the vast majority of drone users to continue flying safely and responsibly, while also paving the way for drone technology to revolutionise businesses and public services.”</p> \n<p>Tim Johnson, policy director at the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said: “The CAA supports the safe development of drones in the UK. Drones can bring economic and workplace safety benefits but to achieve those we need everyone flying a drone now to do so safely. We welcome plans to increase drone operator training, safety awareness and the creation of no-fly zones.”</p> \n<p>National Police Chiefs’ Council lead for criminal misuse of drones, Assistant Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, said: “Police forces are aware of the ever increasing use of drones by members of the public and we are working with all relevant partners to understand the threats that this new technology can pose when used irresponsibly or illegally. Do not take this lightly – if you use a drone to invade people’s privacy or engage in disruptive behaviour, you could face serious criminal charges.”</p> \n<p>The 250g weight limit proposed by the new law is the same as that used in the US to define the lowest-risk category of drones – those that weigh so little that they are unlikely to damage people or property in the event of failure.</p> \n<p>But major drone manufacturers including DJI, a Chinese firm that dominates the market for semi-professional UAVs, have attacked the weight limit for being based on “poorly chosen data and deeply flawed assumptions.”</p> \n<p>The US regulator’s calculations, <a href=\"https://www.dji.com/newsroom/news/dji-proposes-higher-maximum-weight-for-lowest-risk-drone-category\">DJI said</a>, “were based on assumptions dating back 48 years about the lack of medical care in a thermonuclear war. These assumptions, which should have been rejected long ago as a basis for measuring … impact risk, result in a far higher estimated fatality rate than is realistic in a modern society.”</p> \n<p>Instead, the drone manufacturer argued, “the upper weight limit for a ‘lowest-risk’ [drone] is nearly an order of magnitude greater: around 2.2 kilograms”.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/08/uber-signs-contract-nasa-develop-flying-taxi-software\"><strong>Uber signs contract with Nasa to develop flying taxi software</strong></a><br /></li> \n</ul>"

However, it is hard to separate the machinations of the FCC’s market-driven agenda from a political agenda that is only interested in regulating media as a free market rather than a civic service or cultural good.</p> \n<p>On the left, critics have been alarmed at how the rollback of rules around broadcasting might enable the rapidly growing Sinclair Broadcast Group to push through its purchase of Tribune Group, another local media company, for $4bn. Sinclair has a record of airing programming that favours Republican and right-of-centre politics, and now it is set to become the largest local broadcasting company in the US. Although all cable viewing is in decline in the US, cable news at local level still exerts a strong influence.</p> \n<p>In fact, the only sign that the FCC isn’t on a headlong path to abolish all regulation is its insistence that a potential merger between Time Warner and Comcast (the vast cable company that also owns the NBC Universal television and entertainment business) must see the disposal of assets for fear of making the company “too big”. One potential asset in play as a result of this is Donald Trump’s least favourite news network, CNN.</p> \n<p>The American public is part of a giant experiment in media deregulation with little protection for the consumer. Even if the agenda of Pai and the FCC is not overtly political, it still carries with it an ideology that plurality of voices in the media landscape is less important than efficient business competition. </p> \n<h2><strong>US media reels from new wave of instability</strong></h2> \n<p>At the end of an exhausting year of political drama and natural disasters, US media is reeling from a new wave of systemic instability. A trickle of bad news for businesses whose income is based on advertising, both old and new, is threatening to turn into full blown media recession.<br /></p> \n<p>Here is the misery ledger for the past week: both BuzzFeed and Vice have reportedly missed their annual revenue targets, with the Wall Street Journal claiming in BuzzFeed’s case this might be by as much as 20%. CNN Digital was also reported to have fallen short of targets by $20m; the Daily Beast is allegedly being put up for sale by its owner, IAC; Univision is looking for a $200m cash injection for its digital division Fusion Media; and Mashable, which last year sacked most of its newsroom in a “pivot to video”, was sold to Ziff Davis for $50m – a fifth of its (largely fictional) valuation a year ago.</p> \n<p>So, what went wrong? The first and most important component of this decline is a wholesale restructuring of the advertising market, which has largely eliminated publishers and advertising agencies from the picture. Google and Facebook continue to see advertising revenues rise but even companies that grew impressive native advertising businesses have struggled. And even the large bets placed by venture capital investors over the past decade in digitally native news outlets are beginning to look perilous. Once investors move to take their money out, expect to see further sales, restructuring and closures. </p> \n<p>But lastly, in a enormously oversupplied national and international media market, the ability to generate loyalty and revenues away from the swamp of social media is increasingly important. “Social first” used to be a an advantage for companies like Mashable, but now it serves more as a warning to consumers.</p> \n<p>Worryingly, the economic context market remains theoretically favourable. The US economy is still in growth and the stock market is at an all-time high, the global economy is also in reasonable shape, and we cannot ignore that 2017 was a booming year for news. But, as every business knows, if you are struggling to make your targets in a strong economy, then it does not bode well for times of greater economic hardship.</p>"

This <a href=\"http://www.honda.co.uk/cars/new/civic-type-r/overview.html\">Honda Civic Type R</a> has been designed to go stomach-flippingly fast… so I used it to drive my 85-year-old mother-in-law to her surprise birthday lunch. She thought it was, “Yes, quite nice.” But she struggled to get in and out of the 8in deep bucket seats.</p> <p>The Type R is to hot hatches what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/quentintarantino\">Stephen King</a> is to safety manuals. It’s a vicious monster thinly disguised as a four-door family hatch. From a distance it looks like a ferocious samurai warlord, but up close it seems to have more in common with a giant cycling helmet. Every panel bulges with air intakes; the plastic skirts and carbon valences hover inches from the ground, and the huge rear wing seems to have sprouted mini wings. It has three exhaust pipes for heaven’s sake. It’s as if this Honda has dressed up as its favourite superhero character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"168caf33af3e8a215289155a10b1b951de1db516\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/168caf33af3e8a215289155a10b1b951de1db516/0_223_4480_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Command centre: the race-oriented interior and cockpit of the Type R\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Command centre: the race-oriented interior and cockpit of the Type R</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it’s not just a showboater, either. Earlier this year the pro racing driver Christian Menzel took it to the <a href=\"http://www.nuerburgring.de/en/fans-info/race-tracks/nordschleife.html\">Nordschleife</a> at the infamous <a href=\"http://www.nuerburgring.de/\">Nürburgring</a> in Germany, and calmly clocked the fastest-ever time for a front-wheel car round the 154 turns of the 12.3-mile circuit. You can enjoy a back-seat view of his 7:43 minute lap by watching footage from his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6LAB4cZ2V3Y\">onboard camera</a>. It’s astonishing, and quite sickening, especially if you keep an eye on his G-Force monitor.</p> <p>This latest Civic celebrates 25 years of the Type R. It’s longer, lower and wider than its predecessor, and it’s even more powerful. In case it fails to scratch that itch you can crank up the driving dynamics. There are three settings to choose from: Comfort; Sport, and +R. Your selection maps pre-set changes on to the damper valves, steering weight, throttle response, stability and traction control. I love that fact that “Sport” is the default setting, but it’s the Comfort setting that saves the day. On our knackered British roads the old Type R could shake the fillings from your teeth. This one is a pleasure to drive even on longer journeys. The effervescent performance from the 316bhp 2-litre 4-cylinder turbo engine isn’t so much breathtaking as a flying dropkick to the ribs. It has a top speed of 169mph and will hit 0-62mph in under 6 seconds. The handling is compulsive. You find yourself yearning for fast back-to-back bends. In fact, even swinging through a roundabout is a pleasure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6da88594b6e5c596aa8a73048d271cef837ca4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6da88594b6e5c596aa8a73048d271cef837ca4c/0_1748_2267_1360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Triple threat: the rear view of the Type R with its three exhaust pipes and giant wing\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Triple threat: the rear view of the Type R with its three exhaust pipes and giant wing</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The twist in the tale for the Type R has always been that despite its superhero antics, it’s still such a usable car. It’s the ultimate weekday workhorse and weekend warrior. It’s spacious inside and has a big boot. Annoyingly, despite the fact there is room for three in the back, it is only fitted with two rear seatbelts. Up front the cabin is an exuberant mishmash of carbon surfaces and shiny plastics, and bright-red racing seats. The gear stick is topped with an aluminium ball that fits perfectly into your palm. . The digital interface looks like a refugee from the 90s – overly large type and tiny buttons make it tricky to use and decipher. It amazes me how many cars get this wrong. We are <em>all</em> now screen savvy. Anyone with a smartphone will expect better. On the other hand, in this car you’ll only have eyes for the road ahead.</p> <h2>#BEAUTIFULWONTBETAMED: Rankin and Aston Martin</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"new film of vantage sports car\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/244016156&quot; width=&quot;640&quot; height=&quot;360&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/244016156&quot;&gt;Aston Martin- Vantage&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/rankinfilm&quot;&gt;RankinFilm&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com&quot;&gt;Vimeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>The new<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://global.astonmartin.com/en-gb/models/new-vantage\">Aston Martin Vantage</a> made its global debut this week with a unique portfolio of imagery and film by Rankin, one of the most influential photographers of our generation<strong>. </strong>Together Aston Martin and Rankin put you on the edge of your seats with their extraordinary showcase of fearsome animals, the human species and of course the car.

Is it safe to buy a write-off? Can I find out what the damage is if I want to buy a categorised car? Message forums and boards are full of questions asking just this, and now drivers are asking for some clarity in the answers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://scrapcarcomparison.co.uk/\">Scrapcarcomparison</a>, the only UK comparison site giving you the best prices for scrap and damaged vehicles, says homework is needed on purchasing a write-off. “It’s amazing how many people don’t do their homework when faced with a ‘good deal’,” says a spokesperson site. A deal may look good on the outside, but you need to do your background checks. Category cars can be good value for money providing you take your time and go through the proper procedures so that you know the vehicle’s history.”</p> <p>The new recent changes to the insurance categories are designed to make things clearer for all. The write-offs were previously put into four categories: A, B, C and D. Category A is the most severe level for irreparable damage whilst Category D is for vehicles that could be returned back to the road. The new system replaces C and D with the new categories of S and N, now giving the new structure of write-offs as follows:</p> <p>A – Scrap only<br />B – Break for parts<br />S – Structurally damaged but repairable<br />N – Not structurally damaged, repairable <br /></p> <p><a href=\"http://scrapcarcomparison.co.uk/\">Scrapcarcomparison</a> has picked up on some of the unanswered questions posed by motorists:</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it the buyer’s responsibility to check or the seller’s responsibility to inform the buyer if a car is categorized?<br /><strong>A:</strong> There’s a law there for trade, but not for private sellers. Trade sellers must legally declare before sale that the vehicle has a category marker against it. However, if you buy the car privately, the seller does not have to declare this unless asked the question by the buyer. They may have already done an HPI check prior to viewing. If you don’t advertise it correctly, you give the buyer the opportunity to reject goods, so it pays to be honest.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the point of giving a car a category if there is no detailed information on what caused it to be in a category in the first place? How can I find out about the damage?<br /><strong>A:</strong> While you can find out what category the vehicle has been given, there is a black hole in terms of UK laws as there is no database recording the reasons as to why the car was categorised. Unfortunately, you have no lawful entitlement to any information, but you could write to the previous insurance company to ask for the information. They do not have to disclose it, but your only other option is to ask the previous owner(s). It is advised you get a thorough, detailed inspection undertaken before you buy a categorised vehicle. Organisations such as the AA, RAC or a respected well-trained mechanic can inspect the car to look into its condition and whether there are any problems lurking.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Should I buy an insurance write-off?<br /><strong>A:</strong> Going down this route could save you a lot of money in the short term – if you do it properly. Providing you are 100% happy with the car’s history this could be a good option. The downside is that when the time comes for you to sell the car’s resale value will be less, and you could pay higher insurance premiums – if you can find an insurance company who will give you a policy.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to tell my insurance company my car is categorised?<br /><strong>A:</strong> The law only requires you to answer any questions asking about specific information and as a consumer you have no obligation whatsoever to second guess information they have not requested. The onus is totally on the insurer to ask a question. Not declaring a material fact you have not been specifically asked about shouldn’t affect your policy. However, we recommend you disclose this as you wouldn’t want to be accused of withholding information in the event you need to make a claim on your policy.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What can a vehicle report tell me and are they expensive?<br /><strong>A:</strong> In 2016, 1 in 10 vehicles were recorded as insurance write-offs; 1 in 8 had outstanding finance and 88,595 vehicles were reported stolen, and vehicle reports can tell you whether a particular vehicle is one of them. The vehicle reports average around £15 and will check whether a vehicle has any outstanding finance, whether it has a category marker, has been stolen or exported in addition to the standard vehicle data. Each report varies in what it searches for so you’ll need to check each one to ensure it covers the information you need, but they’re worth the money to give you peace of mind.</p> <p><em>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>",

From a distance it looks like a ferocious samurai warlord, but up close it seems to have more in common with a giant cycling helmet. Every panel bulges with air intakes; the plastic skirts and carbon valences hover inches from the ground, and the huge rear wing seems to have sprouted mini wings. It has three exhaust pipes for heaven’s sake. It’s as if this Honda has dressed up as its favourite superhero character.\nAnd it’s not just a showboater, either. Earlier this year the pro racing driver Christian Menzel took it to the Nordschleife at the infamous Nürburgring in Germany, and calmly clocked the fastest-ever time for a front-wheel car round the 154 turns of the 12.3-mile circuit. You can enjoy a back-seat view of his 7:43 minute lap by watching footage from his onboard camera. It’s astonishing, and quite sickening, especially if you keep an eye on his G-Force monitor. This latest Civic celebrates 25 years of the Type R. It’s longer, lower and wider than its predecessor, and it’s even more powerful. In case it fails to scratch that itch you can crank up the driving dynamics. There are three settings to choose from: Comfort; Sport, and +R. Your selection maps pre-set changes on to the damper valves, steering weight, throttle response, stability and traction control. I love that fact that “Sport” is the default setting, but it’s the Comfort setting that saves the day. On our knackered British roads the old Type R could shake the fillings from your teeth. This one is a pleasure to drive even on longer journeys. The effervescent performance from the 316bhp 2-litre 4-cylinder turbo engine isn’t so much breathtaking as a flying dropkick to the ribs. It has a top speed of 169mph and will hit 0-62mph in under 6 seconds. The handling is compulsive. You find yourself yearning for fast back-to-back bends. In fact, even swinging through a roundabout is a pleasure.\nThe twist in the tale for the Type R has always been that despite its superhero antics, it’s still such a usable car. It’s the ultimate weekday workhorse and weekend warrior. It’s spacious inside and has a big boot. Annoyingly, despite the fact there is room for three in the back, it is only fitted with two rear seatbelts. Up front the cabin is an exuberant mishmash of carbon surfaces and shiny plastics, and bright-red racing seats. The gear stick is topped with an aluminium ball that fits perfectly into your palm. . The digital interface looks like a refugee from the 90s – overly large type and tiny buttons make it tricky to use and decipher. It amazes me how many cars get this wrong. We are all now screen savvy. Anyone with a smartphone will expect better. On the other hand, in this car you’ll only have eyes for the road ahead. #BEAUTIFULWONTBETAMED: Rankin and Aston Martin\nThe new Aston Martin Vantage made its global debut this week with a unique portfolio of imagery and film by Rankin, one of the most influential photographers of our generation. Together Aston Martin and Rankin put you on the edge of your seats with their extraordinary showcase of fearsome animals, the human species and of course the car. The film gives a real insight into just how powerful the car is. The Vantage is the second new car to be born from the company’s 2nd Century Plan and is the most overtly sports-focused model in the range. Striking to the eye with its defined bold new look, intensified performance and dynamics, who wouldn’t want to get their hands on this one. Vehicle write-offs: the unanswered questions, by Dean Adams\nIn light of the insurance industry’s changes to the categorisation of vehicle write-offs as of 1 October 2017, it’s still left many motorists with unanswered questions. Is it safe to buy a write-off? Can I find out what the damage is if I want to buy a categorised car? Message forums and boards are full of questions asking just this, and now drivers are asking for some clarity in the answers. Scrapcarcomparison, the only UK comparison site giving you the best prices for scrap and damaged vehicles, says homework is needed on purchasing a write-off. “It’s amazing how many people don’t do their homework when faced with a ‘good deal’,” says a spokesperson site. A deal may look good on the outside, but you need to do your background checks. Category cars can be good value for money providing you take your time and go through the proper procedures so that you know the vehicle’s history.” The new recent changes to the insurance categories are designed to make things clearer for all. The write-offs were previously put into four categories: A, B, C and D. Category A is the most severe level for irreparable damage whilst Category D is for vehicles that could be returned back to the road. The new system replaces C and D with the new categories of S and N, now giving the new structure of write-offs as follows: A – Scrap only B – Break for parts S – Structurally damaged but repairable N – Not structurally damaged, repairable Scrapcarcomparison has picked up on some of the unanswered questions posed by motorists: Q: Is it the buyer’s responsibility to check or the seller’s responsibility to inform the buyer if a car is categorized? A: There’s a law there for trade, but not for private sellers. Trade sellers must legally declare before sale that the vehicle has a category marker against it. However, if you buy the car privately, the seller does not have to declare this unless asked the question by the buyer. They may have already done an HPI check prior to viewing. If you don’t advertise it correctly, you give the buyer the opportunity to reject goods, so it pays to be honest. Q: What is the point of giving a car a category if there is no detailed information on what caused it to be in a category in the first place? How can I find out about the damage? A: While you can find out what category the vehicle has been given, there is a black hole in terms of UK laws as there is no database recording the reasons as to why the car was categorised. Unfortunately, you have no lawful entitlement to any information, but you could write to the previous insurance company to ask for the information. They do not have to disclose it, but your only other option is to ask the previous owner(s). It is advised you get a thorough, detailed inspection undertaken before you buy a categorised vehicle. Organisations such as the AA, RAC or a respected well-trained mechanic can inspect the car to look into its condition and whether there are any problems lurking. Q: Should I buy an insurance write-off? A: Going down this route could save you a lot of money in the short term – if you do it properly. Providing you are 100% happy with the car’s history this could be a good option. The downside is that when the time comes for you to sell the car’s resale value will be less, and you could pay higher insurance premiums – if you can find an insurance company who will give you a policy. Q: Do I have to tell my insurance company my car is categorised? A: The law only requires you to answer any questions asking about specific information and as a consumer you have no obligation whatsoever to second guess information they have not requested. The onus is totally on the insurer to ask a question. Not declaring a material fact you have not been specifically asked about shouldn’t affect your policy. However, we recommend you disclose this as you wouldn’t want to be accused of withholding information in the event you need to make a claim on your policy. Q: What can a vehicle report tell me and are they expensive? A: In 2016, 1 in 10 vehicles were recorded as insurance write-offs; 1 in 8 had outstanding finance and 88,595 vehicles were reported stolen, and vehicle reports can tell you whether a particular vehicle is one of them. The vehicle reports average around £15 and will check whether a vehicle has any outstanding finance, whether it has a category marker, has been stolen or exported in addition to the standard vehicle data. Each report varies in what it searches for so you’ll need to check each one to ensure it covers the information you need, but they’re worth the money to give you peace of mind.

Annoyingly, despite the fact there is room for three in the back, it is only fitted with two rear seatbelts. Up front the cabin is an exuberant mishmash of carbon surfaces and shiny plastics, and bright-red racing seats. The gear stick is topped with an aluminium ball that fits perfectly into your palm. . The digital interface looks like a refugee from the 90s – overly large type and tiny buttons make it tricky to use and decipher. It amazes me how many cars get this wrong.

The film gives a real insight into just how powerful the car is. The Vantage is the second new car to be born from the company’s 2nd Century Plan and is the most overtly sports-focused model in the range.

                    "html": "<p>In light of the insurance industry’s changes to the categorisation of vehicle write-offs as of 1 October 2017, it’s still left many motorists with unanswered questions. Is it safe to buy a write-off? Can I find out what the damage is if I want to buy a categorised car? Message forums and boards are full of questions asking just this, and now drivers are asking for some clarity in the answers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://scrapcarcomparison.co.uk/\">Scrapcarcomparison</a>, the only UK comparison site giving you the best prices for scrap and damaged vehicles, says homework is needed on purchasing a write-off. “It’s amazing how many people don’t do their homework when faced with a ‘good deal’,” says a spokesperson site. A deal may look good on the outside, but you need to do your background checks. Category cars can be good value for money providing you take your time and go through the proper procedures so that you know the vehicle’s history.”</p> \n<p>The new recent changes to the insurance categories are designed to make things clearer for all. The write-offs were previously put into four categories: A, B, C and D. Category A is the most severe level for irreparable damage whilst Category D is for vehicles that could be returned back to the road. The new system replaces C and D with the new categories of S and N, now giving the new structure of write-offs as follows:</p> \n<p>A – Scrap only<br />B – Break for parts<br />S – Structurally damaged but repairable<br />N – Not structurally damaged, repairable <br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://scrapcarcomparison.co.uk/\">Scrapcarcomparison</a> has picked up on some of the unanswered questions posed by motorists:</p> \n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Is it the buyer’s responsibility to check or the seller’s responsibility to inform the buyer if a car is categorized?<br /><strong>A:</strong> There’s a law there for trade, but not for private sellers. Trade sellers must legally declare before sale that the vehicle has a category marker against it. However, if you buy the car privately, the seller does not have to declare this unless asked the question by the buyer. They may have already done an HPI check prior to viewing. If you don’t advertise it correctly, you give the buyer the opportunity to reject goods, so it pays to be honest.</p> \n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What is the point of giving a car a category if there is no detailed information on what caused it to be in a category in the first place? How can I find out about the damage?<br /><strong>A:</strong> While you can find out what category the vehicle has been given, there is a black hole in terms of UK laws as there is no database recording the reasons as to why the car was categorised. Unfortunately, you have no lawful entitlement to any information, but you could write to the previous insurance company to ask for the information. They do not have to disclose it, but your only other option is to ask the previous owner(s). It is advised you get a thorough, detailed inspection undertaken before you buy a categorised vehicle. Organisations such as the AA, RAC or a respected well-trained mechanic can inspect the car to look into its condition and whether there are any problems lurking.</p> \n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Should I buy an insurance write-off?<br /><strong>A:</strong> Going down this route could save you a lot of money in the short term – if you do it properly. Providing you are 100% happy with the car’s history this could be a good option. The downside is that when the time comes for you to sell the car’s resale value will be less, and you could pay higher insurance premiums – if you can find an insurance company who will give you a policy.</p> \n<p><strong>Q:</strong> Do I have to tell my insurance company my car is categorised?<br /><strong>A:</strong> The law only requires you to answer any questions asking about specific information and as a consumer you have no obligation whatsoever to second guess information they have not requested. The onus is totally on the insurer to ask a question. Not declaring a material fact you have not been specifically asked about shouldn’t affect your policy. However, we recommend you disclose this as you wouldn’t want to be accused of withholding information in the event you need to make a claim on your policy.</p> \n<p><strong>Q:</strong> What can a vehicle report tell me and are they expensive?<br /><strong>A:</strong> In 2016, 1 in 10 vehicles were recorded as insurance write-offs; 1 in 8 had outstanding finance and 88,595 vehicles were reported stolen, and vehicle reports can tell you whether a particular vehicle is one of them. The vehicle reports average around £15 and will check whether a vehicle has any outstanding finance, whether it has a category marker, has been stolen or exported in addition to the standard vehicle data. Each report varies in what it searches for so you’ll need to check each one to ensure it covers the information you need, but they’re worth the money to give you peace of mind.</p> \n<p><em>Email Martin at <a href=\"mailto:https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">martin.love@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\">@MartinLove166</a></em></p>"

              "bodyTextSummary": "The social services minister, Christian Porter, has ordered an investigation of a data breach affecting 8,500 current and former Department of Social Services employees, whose personal information was left open for more than a year. The move comes after the Greens blamed outsourcing for the breach in the Business Information Services system which held expenses and credit-card information dating from 2004 to 2015. The opposition’s social services spokeswoman, Jenny Macklin, and cybersecurity spokeswoman, Gai Brodtmann, said Labor was “deeply concerned” by the breach because the government had a responsibility to keep its employees’ data safe.\nCompromised data included credit-card information, employees’ names, user names, work phone numbers, work emails, system passwords, Australian government services numbers, public service classifications and organisation units. “The minister must now outline what is being done to investigate this breach, explain to staff exactly how their data was exposed, for how long and whether it is now safe, and confirm whether his department complies with the mandated cybersecurity standards,” they said. “It’s the government’s responsibility to ensure the cyber-resilience of government agencies and this responsibility extends to the contractors that government agencies employ.” In letters sent to alert staff, DSS blamed its third-party provider and said the breach was “not a result of any of the department’s internal systems”. The Greens social services spokeswoman, Rachel Siewert, said the breach “demonstrates the risks of outsourcing work on sensitive material to private contractors”.\n“The federal government is continually looking to outsource and privatise department and Centrelink services, and here is another example of the associated risks,” she said, citing a recent decision to use labour hire staff to recover welfare debts. “Handing sensitive material to private contractors who do not have the same checks and balances means that breaches are more likely to occur.” Porter said: “The government takes incidents like this very seriously and the department has worked rapidly to contain the issue.” Business Information Services has had contracts in place with the department since 2007 under Labor. It services a number of government departments and “it is standard practice to approach the market to procure these services”, he said. “I have requested a full investigation of the issue to determine how the breach occurred.” The chairman of the Australian Privacy Foundation, David Vaile, said the department had not acknowledged that outsourcing functions to an external provider “represents an increased risk, and in this case it has come home to roost”. Vaile said outsourcing was harmful “from a governance perspective” because “you can deny you’re part of the problem, you think you’ve contracted out of responsibility”.\nA DSS spokesman said the breach, which was open from June 2016 until October 2017, was closed within hours after the Australian Signals Directorate notified the department. The department told staff there was “no evidence” of improper use of the data or of the department’s credit cards. A spokeswoman for Business Information Services said that as a result of a “control vulnerability” some historical information about employees’ work expenses “was vulnerable to possible cyber-breach”. “There is no evidence of a cyber-attack, only that it was possible,” she said. The spokeswoman said the information included “partially anonymous work-related expenses” including “cost centres, corporate credit cards without CCV and expiry dates, and passwords that were hashed and therefore not visible”. “The bulk of credit-card information within the data had expired.” The BIS spokeswoman said the vulnerability was “secured within four hours”, the data was no longer publicly accessible and it had undertaken a security review. She said the vulnerability was “labelled low-risk”. But Vaile said the breach affected a “significant number” and that employees’ usernames, full names and system passwords were “material that could be quite useful for identity theft, fraud and masquerading”, where an attacker pretends to be an authorised user.",

              "bodyTextSummary": "Uber plans to appeal to the UK’s supreme court against a ruling that drivers should be classed as workers, setting the scene for a landmark legal battle with major implications for the gig economy. The taxi app lost a tribunal case brought by two drivers last year and tasted defeat for a second time earlier this month when the employment appeal tribunal (EAT) upheld the original decision. Uber hopes the supreme court will grant it permission to leapfrog the court of appeal and take its case directly to the highest court in the country as soon as February. “We have this afternoon requested permission to appeal directly to the supreme court in order that this case can be resolved sooner rather than later,” said a spokesperson. The case will determine whether Uber’s drivers should be treated as workers, a status conferring improved rights such as guaranteed minimum wage and holiday pay. It could also have ramifications for a host of gig economy firms, which operate by inviting workers to accept small jobs at short notice, often via smartphone apps. The gig economy has proved to be a battleground for disputes involving firms such as takeaway company Deliveroo and courier firm CitySprint. Its emergence also prompted a full-blown government review into modern employment practices, led by Matthew Taylor, a former adviser to Tony Blair. Uber is understood to be hopeful that the supreme court will agree to hear its arguments directly before or after a similar case involving Pimlico Plumbers, which is due to begin in February 2018. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which is backing the two former Uber drivers at the heart of the case, said it was confident of victory. “It is unfortunate that rather than focusing on how to give its drivers a guaranteed minimum wage and paid holidays, Uber is instead choosing to waste everyone’s time by appealing once more,” said the IWGB general secretary, Dr Jason Moyer-Lee. “The IWGB has already beaten Uber at the employment appeal tribunal and we are more than ready to beat them again.” Yaseen Aslam, one of the two drivers who brought the original case, said: “As the holiday season approaches, drivers should be looking forward to the security of a guaranteed minimum wage and holiday pay. Instead, they now face many more months of poverty, stress and uncertainty, while Uber profits at their expense.” The case hinges on the employment status of Uber drivers, who the taxi app claims are self-employed contractors. Uber says the majority of its 50,000 drivers prefer their self-employed status, pointing out that the two drivers who brought the case no longer drive for the company. The IWGB has said that being granted “worker” status would mean drivers would still be technically self-employed, but would also enjoy greater protections. Lawyers for Uber are expected to tell the supreme court that the EAT’s ruling last month relied on misunderstandings of how Uber drivers interact with passengers. They will argue that the EAT erred in its understanding of whether drivers are obliged to log in to the app or to accept a certain percentage of passenger requests. The legal tussle is unfolding against the backdrop of a decision by Transport for London to revoke Uber’s licence, pending an appeal that the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has said could take years to resolve.",

The result is a rather monolithic look.</p> <p>For such a small thing it looks fairly imposing, and has split opinion of visitors to my house 50:50 on whether it’s attractive, but placed in a corner or on a shelf, it can easily blend in with the surroundings. In fact, when it’s not actively doing something, the Echo Show can operate like a smart, internet-connected version of those digital photo frames that quickly went out of fashion.</p> <p>You can pick from a rotating catalogue of Amazon’s images, a single photo or a whole album of photos from your Amazon Photos library to show on the 7in touchscreen. I was surprised by how nice it was to have a rotating selection of choice memories on display – I wouldn’t have bought a digital photo frame to do the job, but a multi-purpose device seems easier to justify.</p> <p>The time and a series of cards showing latest headlines, calendar appointments and other customisable bits and pieces are displayed over the top of the image, plus suggestions of what you can ask Alexa. Having the time constantly visible is great, but I wish you could remove the “Try Alexa …” suggestions.</p> <p>The at-a-glance information is handy, particularly if you have your calendar hooked up to your Alexa account, and formatted to be readable from across the room. You can turn off the screen manually, just by asking, or holding the mute button on the top for a few seconds to turn the device off completely. The screen will automatically dim when it doesn’t detect your presence or isn’t on a set schedule.</p> <h2>Setting it up</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"883a19879a56b24197cf1048c299bb18f3a350fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/883a19879a56b24197cf1048c299bb18f3a350fc/0_0_4335_2601/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo show review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The buttons and mic array on the top of the Echo Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most Echo devices are set up through the Alexa app on Android, iOS or browser, but the Echo Show’s screen means you can do all the wifi and account set up on the device itself. Put the power cable in the back and simply follow the on-screen instructions.

Along the top of the Show are a row of buttons. The mute button, which turns off the microphones and the camera, is on the left and volume controls are on the right. Surrounding the buttons are the holes for the mic array, which like other Echo devices, hears you over pretty much anything, even when the Show is blasting out music.</p> <h2>What does it do?</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6a2a1cb040a9c66dd700cac796bb76b71e767fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6a2a1cb040a9c66dd700cac796bb76b71e767fa/1_0_4056_2434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"amazon echo show review\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Alexa, what’s the weather like in Kings Cross?’</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Show does everything you’d expect of an Alexa smart speaker, from answering questions to controlling smarthome appliances, giving you the weather or the latest news.

              "bodyTextSummary": "The Amazon Echo Show takes the Alexa voice assistant and squeezes it into a cross between a digital photo frame, small TV and smart speaker for something that’s more than just an interesting novelty. What is it? The Echo Show is effectively what you get if you took an Alexa-integrated Fire tablet, put a powerful speaker on the bottom and framed it with glossy black plastic. The result is a rather monolithic look. For such a small thing it looks fairly imposing, and has split opinion of visitors to my house 50:50 on whether it’s attractive, but placed in a corner or on a shelf, it can easily blend in with the surroundings. In fact, when it’s not actively doing something, the Echo Show can operate like a smart, internet-connected version of those digital photo frames that quickly went out of fashion. You can pick from a rotating catalogue of Amazon’s images, a single photo or a whole album of photos from your Amazon Photos library to show on the 7in touchscreen. I was surprised by how nice it was to have a rotating selection of choice memories on display – I wouldn’t have bought a digital photo frame to do the job, but a multi-purpose device seems easier to justify. The time and a series of cards showing latest headlines, calendar appointments and other customisable bits and pieces are displayed over the top of the image, plus suggestions of what you can ask Alexa. Having the time constantly visible is great, but I wish you could remove the “Try Alexa …” suggestions. The at-a-glance information is handy, particularly if you have your calendar hooked up to your Alexa account, and formatted to be readable from across the room. You can turn off the screen manually, just by asking, or holding the mute button on the top for a few seconds to turn the device off completely. The screen will automatically dim when it doesn’t detect your presence or isn’t on a set schedule. Setting it up\nMost Echo devices are set up through the Alexa app on Android, iOS or browser, but the Echo Show’s screen means you can do all the wifi and account set up on the device itself. Put the power cable in the back and simply follow the on-screen instructions. The touchscreen typing experience was surprisingly solid, meaning the Show took a little over five minutes to get everything set up and watch the useful introductory video that runs you through the basics of using it. All the settings, brightness controls and other bits can either be accessed by asking Alexa for the settings or swiping down from the top. Along the top of the Show are a row of buttons. The mute button, which turns off the microphones and the camera, is on the left and volume controls are on the right. Surrounding the buttons are the holes for the mic array, which like other Echo devices, hears you over pretty much anything, even when the Show is blasting out music. What does it do?\nThe Show does everything you’d expect of an Alexa smart speaker, from answering questions to controlling smarthome appliances, giving you the weather or the latest news. The twist is that most things come with some visual information. For instance, if you ask Alexa for your flash briefing, if your chosen news source has video it’ll show you video instead of just audio. BBC News, for instance, pops up with an hour-applicable update taken from the BBC News channel or similar. It’s played in such a way you don’t need to look at the screen to get the gist, but it’s more interesting if you do. Information cards are also displayed for certain questions, such as the weather, which give further at-a-glance information. My favourite is the display of the list of timers you currently have on the go, which makes it invaluable in the kitchen.\nThe screen also enables one of the things that I’ve been longing for ever since installing smart cameras in my home. With the Ring Video Doorbell 2 hooked up, I can simply ask “Alexa, show me the front door” to see the feed, which is a lot quicker and easier than digging out my phone. Another good example is the playback of music. It works just like the original Echo, with support for a range of music services. If you use something like Spotify, the screen shows album art and play controls. If you use Amazon Music you can also get lyrics up and other bits. It’s not necessary, but the screen adds another element to the smart speaker experience.

Amazon Video is supported along with YouTube, but there is no Netflix. Watching an episode of the Grand Tour is as easy as asking for it and picking the correct episode. You can control playback via the touchscreen or your voice, which is handy when cooking. YouTube support has been ropey since <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/26/16371292/google-youtube-amazon-echo-show\">Amazon and Google appeared to have a spat in September</a>. A browser-based system was implemented on 21 November, which works but isn’t as well integrated as it used to be. A similar system exists for Vimeo and Dailymotion videos too.</p> \n<p>The Echo Show can also do video calling, either between Echo Show devices within the home or to Echo Show devices owned by others, or between the Android or iOS Alexa app and the Echo Show. It works surprisingly well, with a good video from the front-facing camera and clear audio through the speakers. All you need to do is say, “Alexa, call [name of your contact or device]” and it fires up.</p> \n<h2>Sound</h2> \n<p>The Echo Show is the best-sounding, loudest and most direct Echo device yet. It’s two speakers facing forward below the screen easily fill a room. It doesn’t have a tremendous amount of bass, but is easily able to compensate for the din made by all that goes with cooking with powerful, full-range sound.</p> \n<h2>Observations</h2>"

Fitting a smart speaker with a screen adds another dimension to the experience, enabling things such as video calling and watching video – all controlled via voice – that just wouldn’t be possible without a screen.</p> \n<p>But at more than twice the price of the excellent second-generation Echo, it’s also expensive for an Echo device, and the features and functions that the screen adds are just that – value add-ons that aren’t necessary for the regular functions of Alexa. How much utility you get out of it depends on your particular setup.</p> \n<p>For anyone with compatible smart cameras in their homes, it feels like a no-brainer. Or if you’re looking for a device to simplify the video-calling experience. The Echo Show is arguably the best smart cooking companion, offering visual guidance as well as voice, and it is the best sounding Echo too.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Pros:</strong> screen, Alexa, Amazon Video, YouTube, can always hear you, Bluetooth, video calling, excellent smart home control, great sound</p> \n <p><strong>Cons:</strong> always-listening object in your house, can activate accidentally, limited number of music and video services supported, expensive compared to Echo</p> \n</blockquote>"
